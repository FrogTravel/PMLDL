 ♦ Erran Morad trains three men how to infiltrate Antifa. His methods include using knowledge of the television series Girls to gain the confidence of liberals, complimenting liberal men, learning information about lesbians, and insulting Donald Trump. Morad takes one of the men on a mission to a women’s march in San Francisco where they are supposedly attempting to stop a liberal plan to develop diapers that turn babies transgender. The two of them pretend to be lesbians while walking around meeting various people at the march and tag certain ones with tracking devices. Morad has the man press a button on a tablet computer which supposedly kills one of the people they have tagged.
 ♦ In a mid-credits segment, Gio Monaldo meets with O. J. Simpson in a hotel room in Las Vegas where he attempts to remind his girlfriend of who Simpson is. After she leaves the room, Monaldo jokes with Simpson about killing her.
 * * * Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! The only thing we have to fear is fear itself! “Uhh, I don’t know what I said. Uhh!”
 I don’t remember! We are going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I believe that the mentally ill need guns, because they are the people who are most bullied. I am, uh, Billy Wayne Ruddock. I’m here with Barney Frank, who was a congressman and who now is no longer a congressman.
 True. I believe you are from a different political perspective than me. So let me ask you. Do you accept that Donald J. Trump is the greatest president this country has ever known? Oh, not — not — not — not at all.
 What? The answer is, no, not at all. As of now, very little in public policy has changed. Fake news. What’s fake news? You think he is, I think he isn’t. Fine. Well, let’s agree to disagree. So, we’re gonna talk about something that might be difficult for you, something called facts, and —
 Again, w-what — Th-That’s a sort of gratuitous insult. I did come hoping to have a relaxed conversation, and you seem to me to be somewhat on edge about this. Not at all. Oh, well — I’m extremely relaxed. And I’m comfortable.
 Okay. I, uh — I brought my own chair. CNN, the Communist News Network, put out a myth which was called Vaginal-gate, where they scurrilously tried to imply that the President had said horrendous things about women, which was completely untrue!
 Oh, you think the tape was false? Yes, I do. And I have proof. No, you don’t. Yes, I do. I think that’s deluded. What’s your proof? Deluded?! Well, that is — that is an insult, sir. Yes, it’s meant to be.
 That is meant to be an insult? Yes. Well, let me show you. Hold on, sir. I’m not going anywhere. What are you — What are you worrying about? Access Hollywood. What actually happened was they edited the sound. It was a longer conversation that was edited down.
 Okay, but did he not say “grab ’em by the pussy”? He did not. Billy Bush was talking about a rat infestation that he had. This, sir, is the undoctored, unedited audio — Where’d you get it? From RealNewsKansas.org.
 Okay. Hear it, sir, please. Don’t immediately dismiss it. Yeah, that’s her, with the gold. I got a real problem with mice in my house. How do I pick them up? Grab ’em. Okay. But I’m thinking of purchasing a cat to catch those mice. Do you think I should purchase a cat?
 Buy the pussy. That doesn’t make any sense. “Grab them.” Yeah, I think you’ve — I think that’s a fabrication. How is that a fabrication? Because somebody fabricated it. Look, I got to tell you — You heard it. That is evidence. That is black-and-white!
 This is — The fabrication what you played, it doesn’t make sense. No, I don’t believe that Donald Bu– Donald Trump was giving Billy Bush advice about how to catch rats. So, let’s talk about crooked Hillary
 . Did you support her in her nefarious plan to take over the presidency? I supported her in her, uh, plan to be elected to the presidency. So, did you support her? I just said yes. Do you at least admit, Congressman Frank, that Hillary Clinton was running a pedophile ring underneath the pizza —
 Oh, thank you. That is — the pizza restaurant right here in Washington? No, I’m glad that you said that, because — Thank you. Will you agree to that? And I appreciate that. No, I’m not shaking hands on that, because…
 Well, that’s rude. …it’s a despicable lie. How do you respond, sir, to this proof? This is a receipt from the very same pizza parlor. Ping Pong Comet. Do you agree? I — It’s a receipt from Ping Pong Comet. What’s the proof that it’s part of a child-pornography ring?
 It says “CHILD” and, next to it, “FREE.” Yeah. They were giving away children for free. That is sick. At least — They were not giving away children, sir. That meant that the children came in for free, not that the children were given away for free.
 This is purchased from eBay, sir, from eBay, from a seller who is 94% ratified. If you were in the process of running a ring, you wouldn’t have a printed receipt to give out as proof of your criminality, but what “CHILD FREE” means —
 That is how stupid the Clintons are. I’m — I’m not gonna put… But do you at least admit that North Korea controls the news? I’ll take that as a yes. * * * ♪ Today, the biggest terror threat in America comes from radical liberals called Antifa.
 These Nissan Leaf-driving vegans are dangerous… too dangerous for me alone. I’m gonna need some backup. Yalla. Let’s go. ♪ Kill or be Killed I think there’s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it. What about the alt-left? They came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right.

 Glenn: They’re the anti-fascists. They want to take down everything that our current president is doing right. What will happen if they have their way and get rid of fascists? How will America be? Glenn: We will be– become a shithole country.
 We know that Antifa are planning something. Who is brave enough to tackle these anti-fascist terrorists? I will. I will. I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Glenn: Train me, equip me, I’ll do it. To infiltrate Antifa, we have to know how to walk and talk, eat and even smell like a liberal.

So, we are going to learn some phrases in case you have to be a radical lesbian tomorrow.
 Glenn: That’s what we’re here to do. “I hate penises.” Repeat after me. I hate penises. Say it like you believe it. I hate fucking penises. Good. How do you think a lesbian will greet each other? Never put any thought into it.
 A hug? “I just seen that fucking asshole with a penis down there. How you doing?” Good. Pretend to be a lesbian. Is there any good pussy-tail going on around here? Pussy-tail? What is pussy-tail? Sorry. I-I was gonna say “tail,” not “pussy.”
 Okay. And what do you think about the male genitals? I hate penises. I really, really do. Okay. Convince me you are a lesbian. Glenn: Um, you know, the toughest thing for me was coming out when I was at my folks’ house, when I was about 18 years old.
 You like penises? Glenn: Oh, hell, no. That’s why I’m down here looking for some little action, a little pussy action. I hate penises. So, I want you now — we do a role-ing play. They are suspicious. In order to convince them that you are a radical liberal, you will have to be able to show disrespect to the man we all admire most.
 Glenn: Yeah, that will be hard. But I will do it. ♪ How to prove you aren’t a Trump supporter Glenn: I hate that son of a bitch. Man, he golfs every day. He doesn’t get his shit done, talks down. He’s prejudiced against anybody that comes to the country, just a fat out-of-shape motherfucker.
