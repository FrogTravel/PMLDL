 That has been, really, a difficult thing for me. My mother has always been a very difficult person all her life. Very unhappy. I can never remember my mother being happy.   And as she gets older, however she was as a young person, I find it’s just now exaggerated and, uh… so, she’s, uh, 83 and now very extremely negative, very extremely unhappy, and, uh… that has been hard for me… -  -
Hello, audience. Thank you for coming. You are here because you want to laugh… and you want to forget about your problems. But I cannot allow it. You should not laugh . You should not forget about your problems. The world is not funny. -We are all dying. -  The world is not funny. Twelve percent of the world’s population does not have access to clean drinking water. The world is not funny. Guy Fieri owns two functioning restaurants. -  -The world is not funny. So then… now that we understand the context, now that we realize how terribly unfunny the world is… let’s do this. -  -    Entertainers are not here to help you. They are here to control you. -  -Never listen to them. Never give them what they want. And most importantly, never make some fucking noise!
-  -        Hell, yeah!     Hell, yeah!     Hell, yeah!     Hell, yeah! -No, you can’t. -  Mathematically impossible. Listen. Don’t be Pavlovian. I’m looking for actual answers here. Trying to gather information. Let’s go.     Hell, yeah!     Hell, yeah! -Gotcha. Get these motherfuckers. -    Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!   Pot is ruining America.   Where’s the weed? Where’s the weed?   Yeah, we got a room full of potheads. We’re gonna need backup. Over. Psych!       Fuck the police.               No comment! Good call. I have no idea what’s going on over there. What are they fighting about? They have similar hats.       Hell, yeah!   -Whoops. -  I think you’re done with this call and response shit. That’s what I thought. If you want me to get introspective, -let’s get introspective. -                                -  -            -
-So I was at the dentist the other day… -  -Yeah.   And nothing funny happened, so I was like, “Don’t mention that on stage.” I already fucked it up. -No, you fucking don’t. -  You do not. Haters gonna hate, lovers gonna love. You need to reject both sides of the spectrum -to leave a… healthy middle. -  Stop participating. Not a participatory thing going on up here. Trying to immortalize something I’ve worked on for a long time. Shut up!   I have not… made my mind up about… masturbation. It’s weird and I’m torn. You know, ’cause on one hand, it feels good.       Did you not think I was gonna use it, idiots? -  -It’s not a prop. It will be used intermittently.
Guys… I’ve got a lot of problems in my life. I wrote a song about some of the problems in my life . I hope that some of you can relate to it. Here we go. -What? -      They’re being greedy and they know it, okay?                               Case doesn’t fit that phone.           Sorry.               It doesn’t work with the rhythm.
-  Thank you. -  If you were offended by that, it was ironic. Isn’t that fun? I meant the whole opposite of it. White guys , it’s easy to be a white guy . Yeah, white guy, we deserve a… cheer once in a while. Very easy to be a white guy. Very easy. But white guys get a lot of shit and it’s not fair, ’cause we’ve done a lot of things, you know? We invented a lot of stuff. White guys invented everything but peanut butter, I believe. That’s what I was taught in school. Everything but peanut butter. Doesn’t sound right, but the American educational system having a racial bias? No way, Joseph. Guys, white… white people are a little uncomfortable. We’ll do a racial joke about the white people so you don’t feel uncomfortable. White people, we like the same foods. Favorite sandwich, peanut butter and… -  Jelly! -…jelly. -Macaroni and… -  Cheese! Our favorite chips, salt and vi… -  …negar! -Wow! -  -Who said it? Get the cameras on them. Your grandkids are gonna see this, know what a bigot their grandfather or grandmother were. Every non-white person, see who said that, find them after the show. Put the lights down. Their faces creep me out.   Guys, I’m not “perfect,” okay? I don’t “use air quotes correctly,” all right? But I am against double standards across the board. Why is it… that when a woman wears revealing clothing, she’s labeled a slut, yet if I were to wear her skin as a jacket, I’m a murderer? -What? -  If I fuck a kid, I’m a pedophile, but if a kid fucks me, I’m the pedophile again? Twice in a week? What is this? -  -  Hey, Bo. Do you want to sing a song with us? -Okay. -Great! -I don’t know the words, though. -That’s all right. -You’ll figure it out. -All right! -Whoo! -  -What? -  -  -    Wasn’t clever, it was just mean. Bigoted. I apologize for that. So I was interrupted the other day while my– -  Hey, Bo. -Motherfucker. -You want to sing another song together? -I really don’t. -Too bad. -God damn it.   -I’m a faggot. -Correct! It’s not funny.     Can you turn the lights off at least?   Is this funny to you people? Turn it off. Turn the track off! -  -  -Why was it on a record player? -  You got a record player back there? You have hooked up a record player? You know, it’s one thing to make that, but to press it onto vinyl is a whole other thing, all right? -It’s gonna outlive me. -  Just to be clear, I wrote, conceived and executed the entirety of that bit. -Do not give those dumb fucks any credit. -  It’s all me, baby. All me. Look at you people in the Abe Lincoln seats. Bam! Too late. Too late. How dare you make that joke so late?
I’m a big fan of hip-hop . ‘Cause I like words. I like poetry. And hip-hop feels like a way to condense a lot of those things into a short amount of time. There are artists that still do that. Uh… Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, very word-heavy, very poetic. But– -  -What are you doing? Look, this is my show. Do not veer credit to people outside this building. -  -  Most…   most… Hip-hop artists, for me, and it is for me, hip-hop, has traded in words and poetry for beat fetishism. It’s where you make a sick beat and then you rap anything over it. And people lose their minds. I’ll give you an example. Is there a sick beat back there for me? -  -Oh, shit!                 -  Pour me out! -Let’s go.           -  -Okay.         -  -    -  -  Why is there a young boy living alone down the lane? -Who signed this boy’s lease? -  Am I the only one concerned for this little boy? Two examples is enough. -
-Okay, thank you.   A lesser comedian would have milked that for four verses. And a better comedian wouldn’t have done it all.   I’m right in the sweet spot. These, uh… These cannons cost $200, just for that joke. I could give that money to a homeless person, make their day, and I don’t do that very often. That is my first decision every morning. Not today. Nah. I’ll do that tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and it’s still today. Tomorrow’s a relative term. We’re not getting there. Makes Annie more depressing.     -Fuck you. -  You don’t know where I’m going. Don’t act like it. You are not ahead of me. I will retain the element of surprise.   I’m trying to work on my improv. My show is very planned, uh, to the word. -You know, to the gesture. -  And I’m trying to break out of that. I want to make something brand new for every show, that only a few people get to experience.
-What’s your name, man? -Rob. Rob? All right. I’m gonna try to make up a song about Rob …   off the top of my head. This might not work. Um, it’s just… It’s to keep me sharp, trying to… I’m stalling, trying to think of rhymes for Rob. It’s not fair. Okay. Song about Rob. Hit the track.
Fuck.     -  -    -  -  Bo, I heard you had sex with older woman last night. I did. -What’s her son’s name? -Rob, he’s right there. -I fucked his mother. -  -  -    -  -      -  -Did we plan that? We did not plan that. -  -How does he do it? How does he pretend to do it? How does he remain contrived? I’m not… I’m not honest for a second up here! Honesty is for the birds, baby. You want an honest comedian, go see the rest of them, all right? “This thing actually happened.”
-Cool. -    Whoo!   Boy, oh, boy. Any big fans of country music out there? -  -Yeah. Ooh, some people extending my name. “Boo,” that’s also approval. -Uh, I think… -  I think country music… gets a bad rep. You know, why is it that when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fucking turnpike it is art, and then when someone sings about a horse, it’s dumb inherently? I don’t think…   I think some of the greatest songwriters of all time are country artists. Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson… You know? And if you’re writing honestly, that is art. And I would never bash that. Um, the problem is… with a lot of modern country music, what is called stadium country music, the sort of Keith Urban brand of country music, is that it is not honest. -It is the exact opposite of honest. -  Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals who’ve never done a hard day’s work in their life, but they figured out the words and the phrases they can use to pander to their audience, and they list the same words and phrases off, sort of mad-lib style in every song, raking in millions of dollars from actual working-class people. You know the words. You know the phrases. Phrases like…
Sort of a mental typo.                       I don’t like dirt. One verse, one chorus in the bag. Now it’s time to talk to the ladies. I’m hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I’m putting out.       Thought it was a human woman. Sorry.       Subtextually.                         Y’all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?                 -  -
You know, like, that genre. -  They’re lying to you. That’s all. They’re lying… Entertainers, they are lying and they are manipulating you. And it’s not in a good way. It’s like advertising. You deserve better. I’m not saying I’m it, but I’m the guy that says you deserve better. You go get better. You say, “Thank you, weird man. Bye.” Anyone watch celebrity lip-syncing on The Tonight Show, you know? -  -It’s the end of culture. Culture’s over, everybody. We lost. This is entertainment. How is this entertainment? People we’ve seen too much of mouthing along to songs we’ve heard too much of. And this the bread and butter of American television. And it’s always one of two things on celebrity lip-syncing. It’s either a male celebrity lip-syncing to a woman’s song…   “But he’s not…” Or it’s a rich, young white actress ironically lip-syncing to a hip-hop song.       Can you believe this song was once an honest articulation of class struggle?   Fuck these people. How dare they think that them fucking around is worthy of your attention? Them playing Pictionary? Your attention’s a valuable thing. I worked for three years to get it for an hour. And I barely get there.   -See? -    I saw a gorgeous… dick. I was in the public restroom. Some guys might be like me. I cannot use a urinal when there’s a guy beside me. I freeze up. So I have to use the stalls. In this case, all the stalls were taken. I had to use a urinal. There was a guy beside me. I took a little look. You’re not picturing this. All right.   -  -  The bit is over. I’m not talking into his dick now. I didn’t rip off his dick. And I’m now not talking into a severed dick. The show is a series of discrete bits. That one’s over. God, if you don’t get that… -  -  Reset the momentum. I cannot be coasting off the inertia of past jokes. -  -  Need to earn it. Every bit should come out of a vacuum, eh? We all want love. How many single ladies out there looking for love tonight?   Whoo! -Yeah. “Whoo” that sadness out. -  There’s more where that came from. Ladies, I know what you want. Want. Want.
Now… the good thing is that, uh… At least men have very realistic expectations for women… he said, sarcastically setting up a second verse in a comedy song.                           -  -                                          That’s young.   -  -  Original does not mean good. Anyone can do anything. Don’t let me off the hook too easy.
-All right. Uh… -  I don’t want to get political ’cause I only know my own ideas of other people’s ideas. We just played in Alabama. They just like the lights. -I didn’t even need to do jokes. -  “Motherfucker’s got moving candles.” No, not quite.   Alabama was actually nice. You’re elitist pricks. -  -Isn’t that fun?   -  -Yeah, you like that. -  -  And now… what making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich feels like when you’re high on marijuana.     -  -      And now… what making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich feels like… when you’re shit-faced.     -  -  Hey, baby, I’m home. -  -  -Honey, you okay? What’s wrong? -    Are you drunk? Have you been… You’ve been drinking, haven’t you? You’ve been fuck… You’re fucking wasted, aren’t… -  -I can’t hear you. Speak into the microphone. I’m not.   What’s behind your back? What’re you holding behind your back? -Itching. -Just… -Just don’t be– -Itchy back. What is… what’re you hiding behind your back? Just show me. It’s a jar of peanut butter, all right? Sue me.   That’s mayonnaise. That is a jar of mayonnaise. That is not peanut butter. Why are you holding a jar of mayonnaise? Why are you holding a jar of mayonnaise? I’m not holding a jar of mayonnaise. -Touché, bitch. -You know what? I am fucking done with this shit, okay? I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. -I had to be at work at 6:00. -  I had an exhausting day. I just wanna come home, unwind, relax, and I come home to a mess that I have to clean up– -  I’ll clean it up. -No, no! I will have to clean it up. Because you’ll make it worse if you try to, okay? -Yeah. -You know what? I’m fucking done with this. -Are you? -You are so immature. -She’s done. -I cannot leave you alone without you getting shit-faced. This is what I deal with Monday through… -Monday. -Who are you talking to right now? You just gestured to the sink. -What does that mean? -There’s an audience full of people. Okay, you know what? This bit is getting a little too weird and meta. Okay, we’re done with it. I agree. Where’s that going? Sometimes you don’t write an end to a bit, so you skip it. Before they know it, you’re on to the next thing. Guys, I was at the store recently. -  -And, uh, no, I will save you time. I bought something. -  -No, no, no, no. No. Sit in silence. Do you guys know what continuity errors are? It’s where in one shot something’s one way, in another shot it’s another way. You know those things? -Anyway… -    This comedy performance is brought to you in part by… -Sorry about this. -…Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.
- They’re not sponsoring me. I’m just trying to get them to. -  -They’re not returning my calls. Evasively cheesy is more like it. Mmm. Label-less water. Nothing tastes better than not getting sued. I, uh… I don’t love my fans. I have to be… I don’t. You don’t want that… You don’t want that desperate, sort of cloying thing from an entertainer. “My fans, oh, they stick with me through everything, through thick and thin.” Do not stick with me through thick. If I stop entertaining you, throw me to the curb. You wouldn’t stick with your mechanic if he stopped fixing your car. I’m in a service industry. I’m just overpaid, okay?   And a lot of… I feel a lot of artists, pop artists especially, sort of infringe upon… responsibilities that just aren’t theirs, in terms of their audience, maintaining their audience at an emotional level. Some of you might be sad and going through things. I feel for that. Life is tough. I’m not gonna fix that with a song. Like “Brave” or “Roar.” You know these inspirational… What I’m trying to say… is don’t listen to a song… like this. –
-                    -  - Okay. Now… -  -I feel like you pulled back. -  Maybe it’s on account of the fact that I’m telling you to kill yourself over and over again. I’m just trying to make a simple point. That these… That life’s toughest problems don’t have simple answers. You shouldn’t just be brave. You shouldn’t just roar. You shouldn’t kill yourself. But I understand that… it’s a sensitive subject and you’re probably just hearing me say that. And I’ve dealt with… I don’t want to be… Look.
-  -                            -  -                -  - Sorry. -Don’t kill yourself. -  I don’t like explaining jokes that… The joke where I tell everyone to kill themselves -might deserve an explanation. Do not! -  And if you’re offended, do not write a blog. I apologize immediately. Sorry! Right away! -  -  Whoo! What’s that, ma’am? What did you say? This is your moment. Who said it?   Do not objectify me, okay? You think it’s okay just ’cause I’m a dude? You think it’s okay ’cause he’s a dude? That is homophobia. Just the fact that you find it funny. “Ooh, a guy said take off your pants. That’s not God’s way.”   Jesus Christ, you bigots. I, uh… Show’s been pretty rock and roll so far. You know, I know it. -And I… -  I’d love to keep it going, but life is not always rock and roll. I’m not gonna keep life out of my show. I went through a pretty rough…   uh, breakup recently. It was a long time coming. Uh, we had a lot of conversations about it, she and I. But recently we had the conversation… It wasn’t recent, but I remember it like it was yesterday, you know? -  -She came out of the shower, her hair wet, her shoulders wet. -It was a shower. It’s water. -  She turned to me and she said it… She said…                   Then I said… -    -              -  -  I think I made the right decision.                         Oh, my God.           I’m saying how I’m feeling, okay? And then you’re saying… “eat a dick” over and over again. Does that seem mature to you?                   I thought we had a future together, you fucking whore.                   Really?                   -  -  Hey, if you guys are having a good time, make some silence. -  -Cool. -  -Uh… What’s this show about? What am I talking about, you know? To… to summarize the show, though… Me! Me! Me! But… if you take one thing away from my show… I hope it’s a T-shirt. We’re selling them out there. This is all a front for the brand. But what is this show about? What do you think, industrial piping? -  -Close. -  -Stay out of it.   It’s about… Mute this. -But for real, what is it about? -  It’s about… performing… -I try to… -  …make my show about other things, but it always ends up becoming about performing. I started performing very young, as a teenager, you know, professionally. And as a comedian, what you’re supposed to do… You’re supposed to talk about what you know. And what I knew always was performing. So to talk about…   traffic or laundry felt incredibly disingenuous. But I worried that making a show about performing would be too meta. It wouldn’t be relatable to people that aren’t performers. But what I found is that I don’t think anyone isn’t. Could we get the house lights up for a second? And could you… Let the lights on stage… Let the artifice fade away. -Now we’re all the same. -  -I mean, you’re all facing this way still. -  You know, I look out at… I look out at you and, um… It’s a very diverse crowd. I mean, more European than I would’ve hoped, but… we’ll get there. If I look at the young people… You know, and I feel like… I was born in 1990 and I was sort of raised in America when it was a cult of self-expression. And I was just taught, you know, express myself and have things to say and everyone will care about them. And I think everyone was taught that and most of us found out no one gives a shit what we think. So we flock to performers by the thousands ’cause we’re the few that have found an audience. And then I’m supposed to get up here and say, “Follow your dreams,” as if this is a meritocracy? It is not, okay? I had a privileged life and I got lucky and I’m unhappy.   They say it’s… it’s like the me generation. It’s not. It’s not…   The arrogance is taught or it was cultivated. It’s… it’s self-conscious. That’s what it is. It’s the… It’s conscious of self…   Social media… it’s just the market’s answer to a generation that demanded to perform. So the market said, “Here, perform everything to each other all the time for no reason.” It’s prison, it’s horrific. It is performer and audience melded together. What do we want more than to lie in our bed at the end of the day and just watch our life as a satisfied audience member? I know very little about anything, but what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience… you should do it. And now you’re thinking… “How the fuck are you gonna dig the show out of this weird hole?” Oh, you want me to be funny and make a point? Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. -Batman. So… how do we do it? -    We do it like this. I went to Kanye West’s recent tour, the Yeezus Tour. It was a big, dramatic, theatrical show. He did something very strange at the end of his show where he ranted… for, like, 20 minutes. It was kind of a rant, kind of a song. He had auto-tune on his voice and there was an instrumental in the background… -  -…like this instrumental. He talked about his problems… race… power. His $90 T-shirts weren’t selling very well. That was most of it. And I watched this. I thought maybe I could do this. I’ll be honest, my problems are not as high-stakes as Kanye’s, but I have problems. And maybe a crowd in New York would be nice enough to indulge me.
So as we get to the end of a night of theater… and comedy and sweaters coming on and off, I got one question for you… And that question is…               ♪ I can’t fit my hand Inside a Pringle can I have a huge amount of trouble Fitting my hand inside of a Pringle can   I can get my hand Like four inches into the can   But then I have to tilt the can Into my mouth   But by that point a bunch of crumbs have Accumulated at the bottom of the can   So they all go Spilling onto my face   What I’m trying to say Is the diameter of Pringle cans   Is way too small   I’ll say it again   The diameter of Pringle cans Is way too small   Two radiuses of a Pringle can Is way too small   If you feel me Put your hands up   Come on   If you feel me Put your hands up   Look at all these hands That are way too big   To fit inside a Pringle can   Your hands are too big To fit inside of Pringle cans   Your hands are too big To fit inside a Pringle can   You think you can   I know you can’t You think you can   Pringles, listen to the people   I’m sure 90% Of the complaint letters you get   Are about the width of your cans   I wanna have a daughter   Wanna have a daughter   So I can finally have Someone around the house   Who can fit their hands In a Pringle can   Yes, I’m still On the Pringle cans thing   But that is priority numero uno   I don’t go to the gym   ‘Cause I’m self-conscious About my body   …body…   But I’m self-conscious About my body   ‘Cause I don’t go to the gym   Irony can be so painful   That’s a catch-22   Let’s do this ♪
