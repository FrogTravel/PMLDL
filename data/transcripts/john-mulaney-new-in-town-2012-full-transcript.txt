 ♬ New in town, ♬ John Mulaney’s New In Town… ♬ He’s spilling mustard on his shirt, ♬ He’s got some papers to deliver, but oh no! ♬ He’s successful, and he’s got so many crazy friends! ♬ Ooh, new in town, John Mulaney’s New In Town!
New In Town was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Hi! Hi! Hello! Hi! Hahaha, how are you? Thank you, that’s very nice of you, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That’s so nice of you, I hope you’re having a good week, thank you for being here! I, uh, am doing well myself. In a couple days I’m gonna turn 29 years old and I’m very excited about that. I was hoping, uh, by now that I would look older but that didn’t happen.
I don’t look older, I just look worse, I think. Honestly, when I’m walking down the street, no one’s ever like, “Hey, look at that man!” I think they’re just like “Whoa! That tall child looks terrible!”     “Get some rest, tall child! You can’t keep burning the candle at both ends!”
You ever seen on “America’s Most Wanted” when they age a photo of someone? Just take my kindergarten photo and yellow the teeth and put bags under the eyes and be like “This is what he would look like now”
I was a very nervous kid, I was very anxious all the time when I was younger. But what’s nice is that… some of the things I was anxious about don’t bother me at all anymore. Like, uhhh, I always thought that, uh,
quicksand was gonna be a much bigger problem than it turned out to be. Because if you watch cartoons, quicksand is like the third biggest thing you have to worry about in adult life, behind real sticks of dynamite   and giant anvils falling on you from the sky
I used to sit around and think about what to do about quicksand! I never thought about how to handle real problems in adult life. I was never like, “Oh, what’s it gonna be like when relatives ask to borrow money?”
Now I’ve gotten older, and not only have I never stepped in quicksand, I’ve never even heard about it! No one’s ever been like,   “Ey, if you’re comin’ to visit, take I-90 ‘cause I-95 has a little quicksand in the middle.   Looks like regular sand, but then you’re gonna start to sink into it.”
I was nervous all the time, but I had a good family, I have wonderful parents. A lot of guys my age I’ll hear them say this, they’ll go,   “Every day I think I’m becoming more like my dad”. I think I’m becoming more like my mom? Because I- I was watching that show “Access Hollywood” and one of the reporters said,   “Up next, we’ve got an exclusive interview with Sandra Bullock’s former husband Jessie James,” and out loud, I went,   “Euch! This oughta be good!”
That’s pure mom. My parents are both lawyers, they are BOTH lawyers, and sometimes they would be like lawyers with us when we were kids. I remember one time I was in bed, and my dad came in and he said “Good night, John! Did you brush your teeth?” and I said, “Yes”, But here’s the thing.     I hadn’t.
But who cares? I didn’t have, like, a job interview or anything. So my dad comes back and in a couple minutes holding my toothbrush   He says, “John, is this your toothbrush?” and I said “Yes”, and he said,   “So we agree that this is your toothbrush?”
But he said, “John this toothbrush is   bone-dry.” Yea, like he looked down and he said   “bone-dry”. He said, “You lied to me!” and I said “Dad,   I did not lie, I said that I brushed my teeth, I never specified that I brushed my teeth tonight!   And if the court reporter reads back my remarks, you will see that I did not perjure myself.”
My mom’s also a lawyer, she was a different kind of lawyer with us when we were kids. My mom was more like Nancy Grace. She would just make wild accusations all day long and wait for something to stick.
My mom would blame me for things that happened on the news.   That is true. I woke up one morning when I was a kid and my mom was standing over my bed and said,   “I just heard that Princess Diana and her lover Dodi Al-Fayed have been killed in Paris”
Like I had something to do with it! I was like,   “Mom, I have been here all night. You can feel the TV, it’s warm.” Luckily, I had a good alibi since I was in Wisconsin and 12. My brothers and sisters and I had this babysitter named Veronica when we were kids, and I was   in love with her. I was in love with Veronica. She would babysit us on Saturday nights.
And in my head, when I was a little kid, I thought that Veronica was like 25, 30 years old. I was just talking to my mom the other week, I found out that when I was 10 Veronica was 13. So why was she in charge? All she could do was dial the telephone a little better than I could.
13 when I’m 10? That’s just like hiring a slightly bigger child. That would be like if you’re going out of town for the week and you paid a horse to watch your dog. Like,   “All right, here is the number where we’ll be,   and here’s where we keep the dog food,   and you’re a horse.”       “Shh shh shh shh shh, shh shh shh, shh shh”
Why do people do that? People always shush animals. They’ll go,     “Hey, shh shh shh…”   They’ve never spoken. I always wanted to live in New York when I was a kid, I’m so excited that I get to live in New York. I saw New York City in a movie when I was a kid, it was called
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York . It is a sequel,   Yeah, how about that movie? It was a sequel to the movie Home Alone . I remember in that movie — oh, the kid in Home Alone 2 . He gets into a stretch limousine on 5th avenue with a large cheese pizza and I thought,   “THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF LUXURY!!”
Now I live in New York and I’m psyched,   but that is a stupid movie title.   Lost in New York? The streets are numbered. How’d you get lost in New York? I know it’s kind of stupid to complain about a movie that came out 17 years ago, but I wasn’t a comedian back then. So I have to do it now. I wish I’d been. I wish I’d been a Def Jam comic when that movie came out.   I would have torn it to pieces! Be like,   “You seen this shit? You seen this Home Alone 2: Lost in New York shit? It’s a grid system, motherfucker!     Where you at? 24th and 5th? Where you wanna go? 35th and 6th? 11 up and 1 over, you simple bitch!!”
That’d be my big joke. That’d be the closer. If I was a Def Jam comic when that movie came out.   But alas, I was not. I think the bullying that young people have to go through now is really rough, I really sympathize, ‘cause I was bullied when I was a kid. When I was in grade school, I was bullied for being Asian-American. Aaaand, the biggest problem with that… is that I am not Asian-American.
But when I was younger,   and this is absolutely true, people thought that I might be Asian-American.   I have pretty thin eyes, I had very thin eyes when I was a little kid   and I had straight black hair that I wore in a bowl cut. And from the ages of 3 to 8, people thought that I might be a young Chinese person.
On the first day that he met me, the guy that is now my best friend — he met me the first day of kindergarten — he went home that night and said, “Papa, today I met a boy with no eyes.”     And that was me.
Kids would make fun of me in middle school. Kids would call me a “china man”, which of the racial slurs has got to be the laziest.   That is just pushing two words together,   no work was done there. It was very confusing to me because I’m not Chinese, no one in my family is remotely Asian. I mean, we take our shoes off when we come inside, but that was more of a carpeting thing that anything else.
Here’s how bad it got, though… I remember when I was in junior high, we had this music appreciation class that we never appreciated. And they took us to hear some classical music once at a symphony orchestra. So we go to a symphony orchestra. In one of these classical pieces, there is a moment where they   bang a gong, and every time they banged the gong, all the kids sitting in front of me would stand up, turn to me,   and bow like that.   Which is some racist-ass bullshit, but also   incredibly well coordinated for a group of 13-year-olds.
13-year-olds are the meanest people in the world. They terrify me to this day. If I’m on the street on like a Friday at 3 PM   and I see a group of 8th graders on one side of the street   I will cross to the other side of the street.   Because 8th graders will make fun of you,   but in an accurate way.
They will get to the thing that you don’t like about you. They don’t even need to look at you for long, they’ll just be like,   “Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!   Hey, look at that high-waisted man! He got feminine hips!”
And I’m like,   “No!! That’s the thing I’m sensitive about!!!!” When I was a boy, I was also confused with a woman sometimes over the phone, because before I went through puberty, I had a voice like a   little flute!
I was once on the telephone with Blockbuster Video, which is a very old-fashioned sentence. And —   It is! I was on the telephone with Blockbuster Video… that’s like when your gram would be like   “We’d all go play jacks down at the soda fountain!”   and you’re like,   “No one knows what you’re talking about, you IDIOT.”
You know how you talk to your grandma?   So…     I was on the phone with Blockbuster, and I’d called them a couple of times in one day to ask about a movie, and I called for a third time. I said,   “Hey, yeah, I-I was just calling to see if you had Addams Family Values yet,”   and the guy at Blockbuster went,   “Hey lady! I’ll tell you when we get Addams Family Values!!”
But look, I wasn’t offended as a boy being confused with a lady, I was offended as a lady who was getting pushed around by this chauvinist asshole that works at   Blockbuster video, talking to me like I’m some floozy…   I am a proud Asian-American woman   and you will treat me with respect!   I am a tiger mom!
Now when people make fun of me, I deserve it. Uhh, I do.   When people get mad at me now, it’s my fault, when people get mad at me on the highway that’s all my bad, I’m a terrible driver, I know nothing about cars.   I meant to learn about cars, and then I forgot.
Nothing that I know can help you with your car ever. Unless you’re like, uh,   “Hey I’ve got a flat tire, does anyone here know a lot about The Cosby Show?” and then I could be like   “Oh, perhaps I could be of some assistance.”
I’m one of the worst drivers I’ve ever seen, and I just want you all to know that if you’re ever on the highway behind me, uh,   I hear you honking and I also don’t want me to be doing what I’m doing.   I don’t like that I’m in that lane either, and I sure would like to get out of it!
I was on the highway in Texas recently which was like a highway filled with 13-year-olds.   And I was in the far left lane and then it turned into a U-turn only lane and I started to make a U-turn     but then I panicked because I didn’t wanna make a U-turn! So I put the car in reverse   and then merged right back onto the highway
The best thing about that was that after that, cars were pulling up and   looking over to see who just did that piece of shit move,   expecting to see like   a 100-year-old blind dog who’s texting while driving and drinking a smoothie, instead they see a 28-year-old healthy man trying his best.
It’s wrong to make fun of people, you know, but it’s so fun sometimes.   I’ve written for some TV shows, and, you know, on a major TV show you have to be careful about what you say about people ‘cause a lot of people get offended, or so it has been explained to me.
I was once — I’ll tell you this, I was writing for an awards show once, and I got into some trouble. I wrote a joke for this awards show that had the word “midget” in it. And someone from the network came down to our offices and he said to me, “Hey, you can’t put the word midget on TV,” and I said   “I sure would like to!” And he said,   “No! ‘Midget’ is as bad as the ‘n’-word.”
First off, no.   No, it’s not! “Do you know how I know it’s not,” I said to him, “is because   we’re saying the word ‘midget’, and we’re not even saying what the ‘n’-word is! If you’re comparing the badness of two words, and you won’t even say one of them…   that’s the worse word.”
Also, I don’t mean to gloss over what, like, little people have been through in this country, but you cannot compare the plight of midgets to African-Americans. That is outrageous! Midgets were never enslaved,   unless you count the Wonka factory!
So we get into this argument, we’re going back and forth, he goes   “You can’t put that word on TV,”   and I said, “I want to,” and he said   “If you put that word on TV, there could be a protest of midgets on this building!”   and I said, “Promise?”   How tempting would that be?
I don’t mean to complain about censorship at all though, because as you probably have seen by now, you can basically say whatever you want on television. It’s ridiculous. You can say anything you want! And if you don’t believe me, you should watch a little program called
Law & Order: Special Victims Unit .   Yeah. A show that I LOVE, because on that show you can say the grossest things you’ve ever heard in your life. No, you can’t say like the “f”-word, you can’t say that on Special Victims Unit, but people walk around on SVU going like,   “Looks like the victim had anal contusions.     Yo, looks like we found semen and fecal matter in the victim’s ear canal.”
Those are two real things that I heard on Law & Order: SVU at 3 in the afternoon,   both spoken by Ice-T .   Ice-T is a detective with the special victims unit, he handles New York’s most sensitive cases.
I love Ice-T on SVU. He is fantastic, he’s awesome. What’s so great about him is that he’s been with the SVU for like, mmm, 11 years now, but he still treats every case like it’s his first in terms of total confusion.   Sometimes they’ll be in the middle of an investigation and Ice-T will be like,   “Yo, you telling me this dude gets off on little girls with pigtails?” It’s like,   “Yeah, Ice.   He’s a pedophile. You work in the sex crimes division. You’re gonna have to get used to that.”
You know how they try and tie in, like, current events to every episode of SVU?   So there was this episode I saw a while ago that was about sex addiction, ‘cause a lot of celebrities have come out as sex addicts. So the episode’s about sex addiction. There is a scene in the episode where the other detectives are trying to teach Ice-T what sex addiction is,   and it takes a couple of minutes.
And finally, Ice-T gets it,   and they cut to him in this close-up and he goes,   “Oh, I get it.   You mean like when someone drinks too much, or snorts cocaine, or bets the house on the ponies?” I was like, “Yeah you got it, man.”   And I was psyched that Ice-T understood so that they could continue with the investigation, but I could’ve watched another four hours of Ice-T just naming examples.   Just that close-up and Ice-T like,   “Or like when some smokes too many cigarettes? Or like when someone shops too much with credit cards? Or like when someone plays too many scratchy lotteries? Or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake? Or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake and then barfs it up?”
And he would just keep talking and it would slowly fade out and say   “Executive Producer: Dick Wolf.”   That’d be my ideal episode. That’d be a good one. I saw this SVU a little while ago, I saw this episode of SVU, and Dean Cain was a rapist…   ON THE SHOW.   And there was a scene where they do a line-up with Dean Cain and four other guys and they bring in this woman who’s gonna look at the line-up, and it’s her behind the glass and they open the curtain   and she’s standing with the two other detectives.   And I knew she wasn’t gonna say this, but part of me was hoping she would just be like…   “Is that… Dean Cain?     Fucking Dean Cain?   That’s pretty cool.”
I also watch this show called Cold Case Files . On Cold Case Files , they solve old murders, and it’s really interesting ‘ cause what I learned from it is that it was really easy to get away with murder before they knew about DNA. It was ridiculously easy. Like, what was even going on back then? What was a murder investigation like in 1935?? One cop would just walk in and be like,   “Detective!   We found a pool of the killer’s blood in that hallway!” and he would just be like   “Hmmm… gross!   Mop it up. Now then, back to my hunch…   Hmmmmmm…. Look for clues.   I’ll tell you what we’ll do!   We’ll draw chalk around the body is. That way,   we’ll know where it was…”
A couple years ago, I saw this movie called Public Enemies with Johnny Depp, it was about old bank robbers and stuff. Here’s how easy it was to get away with bank robbery back in the 30’s. As long as you weren’t still there when the police arrived, you had a 99% chance of getting away with it. To the point that, like, those old bank robbers, they take credit for the bank robberies! Like, they come running out of there and they’re like   “Ha ha ha! And if anyone asks, you tell em it was Golden Joe and the Suggins Gang!”   And then they like shoot “Suggins” into the side of the wall. It’s like, what, were bullets free back then? And they don’t even disguise themselves!   They dress up for the bank robbery. They’re rolling in there in, like,   big suits and hats like they’re going to church in Atlanta. They make a day of it!
I don’t know about that.     Oh ho ho! Oh good, it has a mind of its own.     That’s very reassuring. No, no no no…   I don’t like robots…   thinking of things. Hope you don’t mind that I dressed up. It was my first communion today so I decided to come right from it.   I was a very good first communicant.
Thank you for coming to this show by the way, I really do apprecaite you coming to a thing because you didn’t have to, and it’s really easy not to go to things.   It is so much easier not to do things than to do them, that you would do anything is totally remarkable.   Percentage-wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them.   And so much fun not to do them! Especially when you are supposed to do them. In terms of, like, instant relief, cancelling plans is like heroin.   It is an amazing feeling. Such instant joy.
Kids don’t like that. Kids always wanna do stuff. Kids get angry, they go,   “Aw, we didn’t do anything ALL DAY.” You ever ask an adult what they did over the weekend and they say they didn’t do anything, their faces light up. Be like, “What’d you do this weekend?”   “I, um, I did nothing.   I did nothing at all.   Did we do anything?   No, I didn’t do anything.”
People especially don’t wanna do their jobs. I’ve found that out recently too. I have a friend named Megan, she’s an elementary school teacher and I was out with her one night and she was drinking like a monster. And I said to her,   “Don’t you have to do a shift at school tomorrow?” And she went,   “Ahh, I’ll just show a video.” And I was like,   “That’s why teachers show videos?”   She said this, she goes,   “Yeah, I don’t wanna work!” And I was like, “You know the kids don’t wanna work either” and she was like   “Good!”
I, uh, really do — I was psyched to do it in New York. Uhh, I’m really happy to live here and was glad that we could do it in New York City. And, uh, I’m not sure how you all got here tonight, um, but I did wanna say this, I’ve never been, uh, killed by hit men so I don’t know what it’s like in the moments just before you’re killed by hit men, but I bet it’s not unlike when you’re on the subway and you realize that a mariachi band is about to start playing.   Just that brief moment where you’re reading and you’re like   “Oh, a guitar player.   Oh, another guitar player.   Oh, an accordion player —   OOOHH NNNOOOOO”       ♬ This is the loudest thing in the world!
Uh, I was really excited a lot of people, uh, showed up. They told me that it was a big theater and I thought that no one would come. So thank you for coming. I wanted to, like, take ads out in the paper. Like, be — you know, do something to a tot so I get in the New York Post or something.
Uhh, the New York Post is my favorite newspaper. I think it’s great, I read it every day. I like reading the New York Post because reading the New York Post is like talking to someone who heard the news, and now they’re trying to give you the gist.   It’s like, you’d get the same amount of information if you grabbed someone on the street and you were like,   “WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?” and they’re like,   “There’s a perv in Queens!” You’d be like,   “All right, thank you.”
Or rather, it’s like someone read a better newspaper and now they’re trying to text you everything they can remember.     Doesn’t have to be right, just has to be short. I really do love the Post, I read it a lot and there’s a hierarchy in the New York Post. Uh, different people that they like   and different people that they don’t like.   Uh, and if you pay attention,   you can start to identify some of the rankings that they have.
Um, the number one thing that you can be   in the eyes of the New York Post is an angel. An angel is a child who has died. That is the best thing that you can be in the eyes of the New York Post. The less amount of time you live, the better… in the eyes of the Post.
After that,   under an angel is a hero.   A hero is any man who does his job.   You’ll a lot of times see headlines that are like,   “Hero Tutor Teaches After School,” and you’re like   “Yeah.” Down towards the bottom of the spectrum, there are pervs. Pervs touch tots,   tots are angels who haven’t died yet.     There are no children in the eyes of the New York Post.   You’re either a tot   or you’re dead and you’re an angel.
I did leave one out, sorry.   Above perv is a bozo.   A bozo is any man who cheats on his wife.   That guy’s a bozo! I remember seeing a headline when Tiger Woods cheated on his wife and it says   “Tiger says he’s sorry, but Elin says   ‘Beat it, bozo!’”   No, she did not.   She is from another country. And even if she was from this country, no one has said “bozo” in 1,000 years. Who was your source on that, New York Post? Some tiny old lady that chain smokes all day long? They met her in a parking garage and they were like   “Madge, give us the scoop! What did Elin say to Tiger?”   “Eh, she told him to ‘beat it, bozo.’”
I’m feeling good tonight though, I got a massage recently. Went to a spa to get a massage,   I went into the room to get the massage and the woman there told me to undress to my comfort level. Those were her words, she said,   “I’m gonna leave the room, you undress to your comfort level.”   So I put on a sweater and a pair of corduroy pants, and I felt safe.
I’m trying to, in general, take better care of myself. I’m trying to stop smoking, I’ve smoked since I was 13 years old. I started when I was 13 years old ‘cause I stole 2 cigarettes   from my older sister and I hid them in a shoebox under my bed with a copy of Cosmopolitan Magazine.   And one day, my mom cleaned under my bed, and she   found the shoebox. I came home from school and my mom was standing there holding it and she said,   “Hey mister! I found your treasure!”
And I never liked the way she phrased that, you know, ‘cause that made me sound like the world’s lamest pirate. Like, a guy whose treasure chest is two cigarettes and a woman’s magazine.   And my dad came home from work, and my mom told my dad that she had cleaned under my bed and found a shoebox with two cigarettes and a Cosmopolitan to which prompted my dad to ask,   “How does John know how to make a cosmopolitan?”
I’m trying to eat better. I was out to lunch with a friend and I got a chicken sandwich and the waitress said to me,   “Oh, you’re getting a chicken sandwich! Well that comes with a choice of either salad or fries.” Those were the choices — salad or fries, the two most different foods in the universe.   That’s like saying, “What kinda day do you wanna have?   Do you wanna be active and go to the bathroom and stuff, or   do you wanna lay on the floor moaning?”     “Oh, you’re getting a chicken sandwich? Well with that, you can either   go for a jog or smoke crack cocaine.”     “Oh, huh, well…   if I get a plate of crack for the table,   would you have some? You’d have crack if I got a plate of crack? Yeah, okay, yeah we’ll take an order of crack.”
Sometimes when people order fries,   they act like it’s a little adventure. They’ll be like,   “Should we get a plate of fries for the table?   Should we do it? Should we-should we share some fries?     They gotta make sure that everyone’s onboard with it, it’s like   “If I get fries, you’ll have a couple, right? If I get fries for the table, you’ll have —   I know you’ll have fries if I get fries — should we do it? Yeah, let’s be bad! C’mon, let’s do it, all right,   we’re gonna take a plate of fries!”   It’s like a group of couples agreeing to do ecstasy together.
I have a girlfriend now, uh, myself, which is weird because I’m probably gay based on the way I act and behave and…   have walked and talked for 28 years.     I think I was supposed to be gay. I think, like, in Heaven they built, like, three quarters of a gay person and then they forgot to flip the final switch, and they just   sent me out and it was like,   “You marked that one gay, right?” and it was like,   “Oh no! Was I supposed to?”   and they were like,   “Oh man, well this’ll be a very interesting person.     This’ll be a very silly person.”
I was definitely gay when I was a little boy.   A lot of little boys are gay. You know, they’re very   flowy and they have   very hard opinions on things.   I don’t mean that I was a sexually active gay man when I was a little boy, that’s not what I mean. When I was a little boy, I was more like a
67-year-old gay man that’s kind of over it sexually, you know. I was just like an old queen, I would just come out of the recess yard and be like,   “Everyone get outta my way,   I just wanna sit here and feed my birds.”   The gym teacher would tell me to play kickball and I’d be like,   “You want me to do whaaaat?”
Real quick, this happened pretty recently, I was in a restaurant near here in the West Village and I was at the urinal   and an old gay man came in the bathroom with a walker like this   and he said this to me, he went,   “I’m either having a drink or I have to pee, you’re livin’ the golden years, kid, not me,”   like, he spoke in rhymes, it was crazy.   It was such a weird interaction that I wasn’t sure if it actually happened. I came out of the bathroom and I asked my girlfriend, I was like,   “Did you see, like, an old man follow me in the bathroom?” and she was like   “John,   that bathroom’s been closed for forty years!     Whooooooaaaa!!! Whoooooooaaaaaa!!!!
Where was I? I’m not gay, but I might be, and I have a girlfriend, aaand she’s a female person.     It’s going very well, I love her very much, and so a few months ago she was like,   “Okay, it’s going well, so now I should meet your parents.” Because that what people do when a relationship is going well. They meet each other’s parents, and I’ve never understood that. I’ve never been with my girlfriend and thought like,   “Oh, honey, tonight is going great, but do you know what would make it perfect?   Charles and Ellen Mulaney.   Come on!   Let’s get them in the mix. We’ve been going pretty hot and heavy lately, I think it’s time we bring in two older Catholic people.”
My girlfriend’s a female and I had all these friends that were female. So when I started dating her I was like “oh great, they’ll all get along… no.” Not even a little at the beginning. I don’t want to make any generalizations about women because I don’t know shit about women, but if there is one thing I’ve learned in my personal experience is that I think women can be friends with each other,   but I think it can be tricky sometimes when you force women to hang out with each other. I think that sometimes doesn’t work.
Like, I don’t think that you could ever put together a heist with women . Does that make sense? Oceans eleven with women would never work! Cause’ two would keep breaking off and start talking shit about the other nine. Or not even talk shit, just say weird passive aggressive things while they break into the casino.  Just be like: “aww, I love how you just wear anything.”
My girlfriend is wonderful though. I listen to everything my girlfriend says. I don’t mean she bosses me around, I just listen to everything she says because before I had a girlfriend, I never had someone whose always standing next to me   who can just point out obvious things that are happening.
Like we’ll be in a restaurant and my girlfriend will be like: “you ordered your food an hour ago. It should be here by now” and I’m like “yeahhh it should!” It’s like having a lawyer for everyday life. She’ll be like: “the bus driver shouldn’t talk to you in that way” and I’m like: “no he shouldn’t!”  . Before I had a girlfriend, I had no standard of how I should be treated as a human being. You could do anything to me and I was just like a young Motown singer. I was like shiny and dumb and easy to trick. I’m like  : “aww man, you’re gonna give me a whole hundred dollas for all of my songs? Where do I sign Mr. Berry Gordy?”And now when I’m not with my girlfriend you can still do anything to me. I can tolerate any treatment.
Like I try to travel alone sometimes you know and I’ll put up with anything. Like ill book a ticket on some garbage airline. You know I don’t want to name any actual airline so lets just make one up and so lets just call it
delta airlines . So I’ve got my ticket at “Delta Airlines”  and I show up at the airport. “Can I get on the plane now please  ?” And their like  : “NO! ITS BEEN DELAYED 9 HOURS!  ” and I go   “Okayyy” and I go to the bathroom. Then I come out of the bathroom and I go : “any updates?” and they go  : “yeah, we took off while you were in the bathroom. BECAUSE WE HATE YOU. Now take this meal voucher that doesn’t work, GO! FETCH!  .” And I go  : “Okayyyyy” and I go over to the Wolfgang puck express and am like : “Can I have a sandwich please?” and they go  : “NOOOOOOOOO!” and I go : “Okayyyyyy” and they go : “You’re a little fat girl aren’t you?” and I go : “noooo! Noooo!” and they go  : “Say it!’ and I go  : “I’m a little fat girl.” And then I go over to the Delta help desk, which is an oxymoron and I go : “Can I please go home on an airplane?” and they go : “Nooooo! In fact, we’re gonna frame you for murder! And you’re gonna go to jail for 30 years!” and I go : “Why are you doing this to me?” and they go : “Because we’re Delta Airlines: life is a fucking nightmare!” But with my girlfriend she would be like: “Let’s see if Southwest has any flights?” So it’s better…
My girlfriend is a Jewish woman, which is I did on purpose.   Uhhhh, that sounded creepy. I don’t mean like: “ahhh I got one!”  I mean I… I… I’m not Jewish, but I’ve always liked Jewish people. I just like them a lot. And I really like dating
Jewish women . They’re great! Because I think what a lot of people have in relationships is communication cause guys don’t know what women are thinking. And with Jewish women you don’t have to guess what they are thinking. They will tell you. Yeah, this is going to get playfully anti-Semitic so just allow it to go there. I’ll get in trouble, you won’t. I really do mean this though I… I really admire that Jewish people, in my own personal experience, have, are very up front with their feelings. They’re very… they’re very vocal about their thoughts and feelings and I just think that’s really admirable.
You know, I’m Irish, and Irish people wont tell you a thing. Irish people keep it so bottled up you know? Like the thing with Irish people is: “I’ll just keep all my emotions right here  and then one day, I’ll die.” Like in Ireland it’s like : “oh your boy, he died.” And it’s like : “Alright bury the boy, do it bury the boy. Burry the boyyyyy.”   Irish people don’t want comfort. Look at a sweater made in Ireland. Its like a turtleneck made out of “Brillo” pads. I used to date gentile women and…  …  … I dated this girl she used to stare out the window all day long and I’m like, what’s wrong  ? And she’d be like: “you wouldn’t even understand if I told you.”   What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?!?
My Jewish girlfriend and I don’t have to guess what’s wrong! She comes in the room and…  and then we can move on from there. That’s what I mean. She’s very focused. She’s very in the moment, you know. And that’s a good thing in a significant other. She’s very present. Jews don’t daydream,   ‘cause folks are after ‘em and they gotta stay sharp, you know what I mean? They have to be there. They haven’t let their minds wander since Egypt. They just stay sharp. They go  : “Who’s that? Who are you? What’s that? What’s that over there? Don’t do that!”
“I’m Irish… I keep things very bottled up, and I don’t drink . Which is not what you’re supposed to do when you’re Irish. I don’t drink. I used to drink and then I drank too much and I had to stop. That surprises a lot of audiences because I don’t look like someone who used to do anything.   I look like I was just sitting in a room in a chair eating Saltines for like 28 years and then I walked right out here. But I did, I used to drink a lot and then I stopped. I don’t know if anyone here is thinking about quitting drinking but you need to know 2 things if you’re thinking of quitting drinking.
The first is that when you stop drinking and you still go to parties where people are drinking, they will have no idea what to offer you. Like once people start drinking for the night, they forget everything that isn’t alcohol. Like ill show up at a party and they’ll be like: “  Hey everybody! Alright we got Coronas in the fridge and Oh! Hey! Mulaney! Would you like, like an old turnip we found in the cabinet? Would that be good for you? Would you like that?  . I know you don’t drink  . Or my girlfriend left a Nuva Ring in the fridge, would you want that?   I know you don’t drink!”
Also if you quit drinking you’re about to lose the greatest excuse in your life, which is  :“I’m really sorry about last night. I was just too drunk…” That is a get out of jail free card that you don’t even realize you’ve had until you lose it. I can’t say that anymore. I can never be like: “Sorry about last night, I was just so drunk.” Now I have to be like : “I’m really sorry about last night, it’s just that I’m mean and loud,   it probably will happen again.”
Now I, myself — I quit drinking ‘cause I used to drink too much and then I would black out and I would “ruin parties”… or so I’m told.   When you do that enough, you black out drinking and you do crazy things, you kind of become like Michael Jackson. Like any story anyone says about you might be true and   even you don’t know by the end. I saw an interview with Michael Jackson before he died and they were like : “Is it true you bought the elephant man’s bones? And he was like : “I don’t know!” Ya know, cause how could he keep track of that?
So I would hear stories about myself. Here’s a story I once heard about me. I guess I was 20 and I was at a party at someone’s house and I had blacked out drinking, and someone came out of one of the rooms at this party holding like an old antique bottle with some liquid in it, and they said, “Hey, is this whiskey or perfume?” And apparently I grabbed it, drank all of it  , “ and said  : “It’s perfume.” And it was.
Another story I heard about myself — this one happened in high school. Uh, We had this teacher in high school whose kid went to our high school. His name was Mr. McNamara and his son Jake McNamara went to our high school. He was a sophomore when I was a senior. So he was two years behind me. And Mr. McNamara was an asshole. And one weekend, he and his wife decided to leave town, which you should never do IF YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!   And Jake McNamara decided to throw a party at the teacher’s house.   Hooray! And everyone around town heard about it and we all got up individually and thought , “Okay, let’s go over there and destroy the place.”
I walked into this party. Everyone I had even met was at this party, and everyone was drinking like it was the end of the world.   People were drinking like it was the civil war and a doctor was coming to saw our legs off.  It was totally unsupervised; we were like dogs without horses… we were running wild. I walked down   I walked down to the basement, they had a pool table in the basement. One dude took a running start and threw his body onto the pool table and broke it in half. Another kid found out which room was Mr. McNamara’s and went upstairs and took a shit ON HIS COMPUTER!   So the party was going great  .
I’m standing in the basement, and I’m holding a red cup you’ve seen in movies. And I’m standing there and I’m holding a red cup and I’m starting to black out and I guess someone said like “something something police.” and in a brilliant moment of word association, I YELLED “FUCK DA POLICE! FUCK DA POLICE!”  . And everyone else joined in, 100… drunk… white… children yelling “Fuck da police” with the confidence of guys who have already been to jail and aren’t afraid of it anymore.  You know, like the: “I served my nickel! You come and take me!” confidence, but white children.
The reason someone had said “something something police” was because the police were there. So a Chicago police officer walked down the stairs and got to the bottom in the basement and looked out over a sea of drunk toddlers YELLING: “FUCK THE POLICE” In his face. He was almost impressed. He was like   “WOW.” And then he leaned into his walkie-talkie and my friend john, who is now a father — this man now has a baby —  he grabbed a 40, smashed it on the ground and yelled: “SCATTER!!”
And everyone ran in a different direction. We all ran in different directions. It was like that scene in “Ratatouille” when the humans come in the kitchen and all the rats go in different ways.  We all ran in different directions, I ran into the laundry room and I jumped up on the washing machine and I crawled out through a window into the backyard and now I’m running through the backyard and there was this big chain link fence and I thought I’ve never climbed a fence that high before. And then I woke up at home  .
On Monday, I went to school, cause that’s what we did back then.   And I’m walking into the school building and who do I see but Jake McNamara. And he says to me “hey, were you at my party on Saturday?” and I was like: “No” you know, like a liar  . And he said things really got out of hand: “Someone broke the pool table, someone took a shit on my dad’s computer, But the worst thing” he says — “the worst thing is that someone stole these old antique photos of my grandmother and my parents are freaking out about it.” and I had that thought that only blackout drunks and Steve Urkel can have  : “Did I do that?”
I figured no, I would never do that. I was never sure until two years later   … relax. I’m playing video games with this kid named Alex that we also went to high school with. Two years later, we’ve graduated by now. We’re playing video games for a couple hours, and then Alex says to me , “Hey, come here. I want to show you something.” And he takes me into his bedroom and then he takes me into a side room off of his bedroom. Never a good thing to have.     And he shows me a tiny room that is covered wall to wall in stolen antique photos from different people’s parties over the years.   And I said: “Why? Why do you do this?” and Alex said “Cause it’s the one thing you can’t replace.”   That’s the end of that story but how fucked up is that? That’s crazy!
So I don’t drink anymore… and its weird you know? I miss it sometimes because drinking can kind of calm your nerves and I live in New York now and sometimes you can see things that will make you anxious you’ll see troubling things out on the street. I was coming into my apartment building one night and I saw in front of my building a wheel chair, knocked in its side with no one in it.   That’s a bad thing to see. Something happened there… you hope it was a miracle… but probably not… probably something worse.
And I don’t like argument, some people like to argue, you know? They think it’s like an art. And I don’t like it, I think its because really ordinary arguments can get really dramatic really quickly. Like I was talking to a friend recently, and I told him I didn’t think I believed in the death penalty, and my friend said to me: “oh, so you’re telling me, that if you saw Hitler… walking down the street… you wouldn’t kill him?”   That wasn’t what I was telling you, but alright, lets talk about this entirely new topic. What would I do if I saw   Adolph Hitler   just walking down the street? Well first off I wanted to know what did my friend mean? Did he mean I see a guy in like the military outfit with the little moustache, cause then I would assume that’s someone dressed up as Hitler.   I’m not gonna kill that guy. I’m not gonna kill an actor and ruin Indiana Jones 5 just cause I don’t understand costumes. Or does he mean I’m walking down the street and I see like an old old man who I think might be Hitler based on my memory of what Hitler looks like. I’m not gonna kill that guy either, because I am often wrong. Id murder him and people would be like: “Woah! You just killed an old old man!  ” and Id be like: “he looked like Hitler!” and they’re like: “Yeah, a little…”
I have a lot of strange interactions on the street. Years ago, I was walking down the street and a homeless guy came up to me. And he walked up to me he pushed me like that  , he pushed me in the chest. And then he said these things in this order. He pushed me and he said  : “Excuse me, I am homeless, I am gay, I have aids, I’m
new in town .”   You’re gonna close with “New in town?” that is not the most dramatic thing you just said. As they said in the movie Jerry McGuire : “You had me at AIDS.” Here’s how I would’ve ordered those things, I would’ve said: “Excuse me, I’m new in town, and it gets worse.” Didn’t that guy practice his like pitch at all in the mirror that morning and just figure out what he was gonna say? Ya know in the morning ya know just be like  : “Alright now what am I gonna do today, what am I gonna do tonight? Imma walk up and say hello, no that’s too subtle imam push him. Imma push him. And I’m gonna say I’m new in town, no no hold back hold back. Save it. Build to that. I’m about to walk up to him, imma push him and go I HAVE AIDSSSS, no that’s too strong… alright.   imam walk up to him, push him and start with the fact that I am homeless, as that is a given. Then for back story I will pepper in the fact that I am gay.”
Which I know its tough for gay youth on the street, but that’s not like a reason for money. You cant be like, hey would you help me out I’m very gay?   Like a few dollars… I always love how he phrased it by the way. He never mentioned living on the street, he said I’m new in town, like it was intriguing. Like he wanted me to set him up with somebody. Like I have a friend whose like: “There’s no single guys   left in Manhattan.” And I’m like: “I know someone whose new in town.”  “What are 3 other things about him?”
Just too anxious for a lot of things, I get nervous all the time, not even about like major life things, just about like everyday situations. Like this is my regular speaking voice, but if I’m in a pubic bathroom and someone knocks too suddenly on the door or stall door, I go into a whole different speaking voice. Which is “Eh, someone’s in hereee. Someone’s in hereee.  ” so they’re gonna be like: “I think there is a carnival barker in there. I think someone’s trying to drum up business for a carnival.”
I decided to do something about this anxiety recently. I decided I was gonna try and get a Xanax prescription. I don’t know if anyone here has ever tried Xanax, but its fantastic   very muted claps for Xanax. You don’t really get woos, its more like yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh. I didn’t know how to get a Xanax prescription though, drugs like that a tricky sometimes, but I talked to a friend of mine and he said oh yeah, I did this. He said that he had a regular doctor’s appointment and at the end of it he said to his doctor: “Hey doctor, sometimes I get nervous on airplanes.” And the doctor just wrote him a Xanax prescription. And I’m like yeah, that’s the type of lowbrow shit I’m looking for. Ill take your advice, friend I’ve never listened to before.
So I go to a clinic, and I go in and I’m just going to go in for you know a regular type of check up and at the end, I’ll ask about Xanax. So I get to the front desk, and they have a “why are you here sheet.” And I wanna pick something that will get me out really quickly. And I look down and I see frequent urination. And I was like, perfect that’ll be a super quick visit you know? Ill just be like hey, sometimes I pee a lot and the doctor would be like  : “Me too, crazy right?!?” And I’ll be like: “I get nervous on airplanes.”   So I checked off frequent urination and I sat down in the waiting area and I waited for 3 hours. I finally go back to the observation room and oh! In the observation room there was a male nurse standing there and he has a Batman sticker on his stethoscope, a Batman necklace and a Batman watch. He was kind of moving around the whole time, he was just like:   “alright! I am too blessed to be stressed! Lets do it! What are you allergic to, besides work?” and then he’d take something and throw it over his shoulder and be like: “Beats working.” And all of his jokes were anti work, which is not always what you want from a health care professional.
The doctor comes in the room and the doctor looks at my chart and he says: “Oh, you’re here for frequent urination, how many times a day are you urinating?” And I tried to think of a number that would warrant a doctor visit. So I said 11. That was too many times to say. The doctor looked at me and said: “You’re peeing 11 time a day? Then you may have something wrong with your prostate. So, what we need to do…” Some of you are ahead of me  . So I don’t know exactly how he phrased it, but the gist of it was: “Hey, if this visit was to continue, I’m going to stick part of my hand up your ass. And I didn’t know what to say. Cause I couldn’t be like: “No that’s okay, I was lying. It was a lie… to get drugs. You know? Like a crime!”   So what I did was, I pulled down my pants, walked over to the observation table and I put my hand on the observation table like this   and by the way, part of me was like: “Whatever… you know? You ever have those days where you’re like: “This might as well happen.   Adult life is already so God damn weird.”
So I’m bent over like this on the table, and the doctor comes up behind me and says “ no no no, not on your hands, your elbows” and he knocks me down like that  . And this is so much worse than this  . I don’t know why, I think its cause this has a little remaining dignity to it, you know what I mean?   This is sort of like, go stick it in, I am an American. This is like you’re leaning over the edge of a cruise ship and you’re like: “ahhh we’re approaching Martinique!” he knocked me down to my elbows and then, he stuck his hand in. and you know how sometimes you’re like, I bet I know what most things feel like ya know? You just think you’ll know? I did not know, what this was gonna feel like. And this was the actual sound I made, I went: “ooooooohhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmm.”   But I didn’t say it, like it came from my vocal chords but it was totally involuntary. It was as if a ghost had been trapped in my belly and finally flew out towards the light. And then, when he pulled his hand out, we had gotten to know each other pretty well, so ill phrase this a delicately as a can. I didn’t not realize than when the doctor pulls his hand out it feels like your shitting cause the only thing to come out of your butt before has been shit.
So, he pulls his hand out and I thought I was shitting into his hand. So I yelled: “I’M SORRYY! This is a very routine procedure by the way for most doctors. And so far he’s had to deal with “OHHHHHMMMM” and “I’M SORRYY!”   And he didn’t even let me off the hook you know? He wasn’t like: “Oh don’t worry, you didn’t shit into my hand.” He just threw his glove away and went “Ahhhwahhhahwa.” And I was about to ask about Xanax but he was like: “Alright your prostate’s fine but we still need to do a blood test.” So I pulled up my pants and shuffled away,   feeling different. And he yells out into the hall, he goes: “Hey! We’re doing a blood test in here. Get in here!” Batman dances back in and he’s like: “  Alright, we gonna do a blood test. You look different, let’s do it.” The doctor left the room, so I’m alone with Batman. I just need this blood test to be over. But first I had to tell Batman something, I was like “Batman look, I’m one of those people who, when you take blood from me, sometimes I can faint. And I was in the waiting area for 3 hours and I haven’t eaten anything all day and I’m really worried I’m gonna faint.” And Batman said to me, and ill never forget it: “pshh, you’re not gonna faint!”
So, I stick my arm out, Batman puts the needle in my arm, and I’m immediately on the ground.   I wake up and I am covered in sweat lying on the observation table. I wake up, I open my eyes and I see Batman’s face. He’s looking at me and he goes: “you gotta go!” and I go: “Can I please talk to the doctor though for a sec because sometimes, I get nervous on airplanes.” And Batman said: “the doctor’s gone!” so I got my stuff… and I left. The moral of the story is… that if you’ve been nervous your entire life, you should ask your doctor about Xanax because if you lie to him, he will stick his finger in your ass. And if you do suffer from frequent urination, keep it to yourself. I went to that clinic 2 years later for a different checkup and as I was leaving, who do I run into but Batman. And he smiled at me and he was wearing reading glasses to show that time had passed.
Thanks very much for listening to me, my name is John Mulaney. You were really fun, thank you.
