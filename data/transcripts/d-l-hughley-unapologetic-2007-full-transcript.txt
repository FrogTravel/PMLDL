 Hey now! How yallll doiinnnnnn. How yall doin chocolate city? Goddamn. Now, there’s some good looking people around here. Give yourself a round of applause.   That’s nice! It’s a mixed audience too, man. It’s the doctor sitting next to the motherfucker that’s gonna rob him after the show.   That shit– Look at all the white people ohhhhh shiitt.   Man I was at the capitol today. I had no idea the capitol was right next to the roughest fucking neighbor I ever been to in my whole goddamn life.   I saw a squirrel with a bullet proof vest on.   Fuck this shit ah. I mean the capitol is surrounded by pedophiles, criminals and drug addicts and that’s just the House of Representatives.     That’s true.   You know DC is a black city. They got to bus white people in. Aint that a bitch?    : We’re going to the city. Let’s all go together.
I don’t understand it. Now we got everybody running for president . We got a Mormon, a black man and a woman. Sounds like I’m getting ready to tell a bar joke, don’t it? Hilary Clinton . Every time she get in front of a black audience she talk black. You ever notice that? She going to fuck around and slip up.   “Bitch, Please! Ohh, oh. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say that shit out loud.”
Who else we got? We got John McCain . He running for president, but he’s 70 fucking years old. Seventy years old, you can’t be president. You must be out your fucking mind.   Seventy. The only job you should ever have is a greeter at Walmart. Fuck you. Shit.   I ain’t bullshittin’. If your birthday got 190- anythang in it, you should be taking a nap.   Let your ass be president you fall asleep on the button and blow us all up. What the fucka–?
Now, Giuliani , he’s running for president. And his sole qualification is that he was mayor of New York when 9/11 happen’. You know, he was there…. so he an expert on terrorism. That’s like me seeing a pregnant woman and go, “ooh, she must be an espert on fucking.”     She was there when it happened.
We got Mitt Romney running for president and he’s a Mormon. And Mormons up to 1978 believed it was a sin to be black. Ain’t that a bitch?     We talking about 1978. That’s two years after the Jefferson’s. Ain’t that a bitch?   How could you believe Weezy aint going to heaven? That’s— Well, I guess you could go to heaven they had a loophole we could get to heaven but we had to be real good and once we got there, we still had to be slaves. Ain’t that fucked up?   You spend your whole life giving up hookers and drugs and walkin’ in Gods light and your reward is to be the limo driver for Donny and Marie. Fuck you. Shit.
And the big question is, Barack Obama is running for president.  : Is the country really ready for a black president?Ha! After the motherfuck we got, come on, now.   Ha, come on.   Let’s be realistic. Heh. How bad could we fuck up? What are we gonna do? Steal an election, start a war, and give our friends jobs we know they ain’t qualified for?   What the fuck are we gonna do? I don’t understand—of course shit would be different if we had a black president.
You have questions at the White House you never had to answer.  : “Mr. President, uh, you know. You’re president now. You don’t have to carry your own gun.” “Uh…Mr. President, I know, we love dogs too, but pit bulls are illegal in Washington D.C. Mr. President.”   “Mr. President, you wife asked for a hot comb. We don’t know what the fuck that is.   Is the comb already hot or do you heat it up? We asked Condoleezza Rice and she didn’t know either.   So we don’t know what that’s all about.”    “Mr. President, are you going to get sleepy after every single meal, Mr. President? We don’t know what itis is, Mr. President.”    “Mr. President, the kitchen called and they said they serve other things besides wings, Mr. President.   Or what you like to call ghetto crab legs, Mr. President.”   “Mr. President, do I have to give you dap every single time I see you, Mr. President? Can’t I just nod in agreement?”
Barack Obama’s biggest problem is not his color. It’s his name. That just don’t sound like an American president. Were used to John and George and Bill. Barack Obama that sounds like the owner of a 7-Eleven, don’t it-ey?   Every time I say that shit, I want a Slurpee, goddamn.   I just, and of course, it would be historic if he became president. They’d put his face on money. All the fucking good money taken. They’d probably piss us off and put his picture on a food stamp and wed be madder than a motherfucker.     “Have you seen the Obama Bucks? That’s—what’s—that’s nice.”
This is D.C. and of course, everything happens here. It is where the immigration debate is raised. And they want to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. I’m like, who the fuck gonna build it?    I know we ain’t.   And I cannot imagine white people working in the sun that long,   “Oh, lord. How many more bricks do we have to go? Jesus. Jose, help me with the wall. As long as you’re on the other side when we finish no one will know. Please Jose.”   Arizona, California, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada was all Mexico until the 1900s. Them motherfuckers’ ain’t crossing the border. We moved it.   These are the people who build our homes watch our children and grow our food, and we want to insult them by building a fucking wall? If were gonna build a wall, at least put their names on it. And tell them it’s a monument or something.   This is for you, Lupe. Here’s your name right here.
This nation was founded by immigrants. Everybody in this motherfucker took a boat.   Some of us willingly.   We actually have a law here that says if Cubans leave Cuba and make it to America, they get to stay. So if I was Mexican, I’d float over to Cuba and ride back with them motherfuckers.     “Are you Cuban” “Si” “Are you sure?” “Si” “All right, let ‘em in…. but if he touches a piñata he’s out of here.
I swear to God” The statue of Liberty you go to New York, it has an inscription on the bottom by Emma Lazarus that is a tribute an invitation to– to immigrants. Give me your tired, your poor, you huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, and I lift my lamp by the golden door. That’s—that shit is beautiful.   But if we don’t mean it, let’s scratch that shit off.   Or at least put,   “P.S. Except for Mexicans. We reserve the right to refuse the service to anybody. She’s holding a lamp, not a leaf blower”   I don’t understand it man. We have a law here.   Uh, y’all riding a yellow bus or something? What the fuck–?
All kind of shit going on. I don’t understand. Of course you can’t say nothing to nobody no more. Everybody’s politically correct . You can’t say nothing no god damn more. That’s the fucking deal. It all started with—remember Mel Gibson said,   “Jews started all the wars,” but he couldn’t take the heat for it. “No, no, I don’t hate Jews. I was drinking.” Mark Foley who molested the little boys the little pages in the—in the—  in the page program   “I don’t molest boys, I was drinking” Well, I done drink a lot in my life. I’ve never hated a Jew or fucked a little boy. I have gotten drunk and fucked a fat woman, but that’s okay.
People saying shit, it all started with that Michael Richards too. This motherfucker said “nigger” eight times before the audience decided they were offended.   “Wait—wait a minute     was that the eighth ‘nigger’ right there? That was eight. Eight. Well, I usually allow myself two ‘niggers’ a year, but this is ridiculous.”
People act like rappers and comedians came up with the word ‘nigger’. We didn’t. ‘Nigger’ is older than baseball, hot dogs, and apple pie.   You show me a white man that ain’t said ‘nigger’ and I’ll show you a 2-year-old. Fuck that shit-eh.   That’s the fucking deaaaaa  .
Jesse Jackson’s gone on TV.   “We should stop using the word ‘nigger.’” Well, Jesse, if we do, you won’t have a job.   And if the po-leece can’t say‘nigger’ how they gonna tell us to get out of the car?   “Get out of the car, sir.” “Oh, fuck him, he’s bullshitting us.”     Look at all the white people.   “I wish I could say that. I do”   well you can, just not here.   Do it in your car, like you always do.     “Nigger!”     I don’t know how I’m gonna stop saying ‘nigger’ when it describes some motherfuckers I know so perfectly.   Everybody know that one motherfucker that can only be described as,   “That nigger, there. Goddamn!” ooh, ooh. “Oh this nigger here, shit! How did he get my goddamn number, this nigger here?”
Truth is I know black men and I know ‘niggers.’ And they all have their place. If I’m hanging out at dinner, I like to hang around with black men. But if the shit break out, here tonight, it’s AND a nigger working for me tonight. The nigger made my hotel arrangements.   The black man picks up my money.   ‘Cause you know, them niggers there, boy they—“where my money?”   “You were supposed to get some money?”   “I didn’t know you was supposed to get some money.”
I—So tired of the shit I see. This dude got offended, man. Just always offended. I say what the fuck I feel. I ain’t trying to hurt nobody’s feelings. I was talking to this Asian dude and I called him
‘Oriental’ This motherfucker   “I am not Oriental, I am Asian!” Motherfucker, I don’t know?? All I know is y’all run from Godzilla the same fucking way.   That’s all the fuck I know. What the fuck I know?   And all the white people   “I wish I could say that too. I can’t say anything.”
The only cool thing about being a black comedian is you get to say shit other people can’t say. That’s the fucking deal. But that’s it. That’s the only advantage, man. But if y’all want, we can switch places. We’ll rule the wooorld  , and you get to say “nigger” “bitch” and “ho.”   And well throw in some of your white women to make it even.   We’ll give em back to you.
Everybody getting in trouble. Don Imus got in trouble, man. Don Immus, I don’t know why somebody would take him seriously. That motherfucker look like a werewolf that didn’t finish changing.   Like he was just about to turn into a werewolf, but the moon went down and uh shit!     “Where’s my cowboy hat?” And Al Sharpton, he was on TV more than the Lady Knights of Rutgers. Ain’t that a bitch? At one point, I thought he played for Rutgers. I’m like, who is the chubby chick with the perm?   What the fuck–? I don’t understand that shit, man.
It ain’t what you’re called it’s what the fuck you answer to. When we was growing up your mom used to say shit like   “they talked about Jesus you think they gonna talk about you?” Sticks and stones can break your bones motherfucker he can say what he wants just don’t let him put his hands on you that, we used to hear that shit all the time, man.   I remember, uh, I mean freedom of speech is a zero-sum proposition. Either you believe in or you don’t.
Pretty soon they gonna tell us we can’t say shit. And that’s the fucking deal, man. I don’t understand none of that shit. I don’t get upset about nothing. You can call me what you want. Like I said it’s what I’m going to answer to. Like Don Immus called them girls nappy-headed ho’s, and that was wrong, ‘cause they wasn’t ho’s.   But two or three of them motherfuckers was nappy-headed. Don’t act like it’s just me. Fuck y’all.   I know something about
nappy hair . I can swim and the middle of my hair won’t get wet. Fuck y’all. Shit.   A sister’s hair and sweat don’t go together, no goddamn way. You know sisters can’t take water in their hair. Are you fucking crazy? You’ll start the game looking like Halle Berry. By the fourth quarter you look like me. Ain’t that a bitch?   “Is that Ben Wallace?” “No that’s Bonita Wallace.”
I go all over the country and I realize, man, there’s other things we could be doing . Like, I don’t knock nobody’s house. I really try not to, man. But you know, we have a lot of problems in our community other than what happened with Don Imus. Like, Don Imus in the grand scheme of things don’t matter. You know that 93 percent of black people killed in this country are killed by other black people? One in three black people in this country and in this city in particular, can’t read. That’s a fucking problem. There are more black men in jail than are in college, and we fucking around with Don Imus? Fuck that.   But I guess that makes sense ‘cause apparently that was the one white man that was holding us back.     Now we got rid of him, shit gonna go good. Y’all know that shit is funny. Fuck y’all. Y’all know its fucking funny.   We have different experiences, man.
I’m so tired of white people falling off cruise ships , I don’t know what the fuck to do. What is this shit all about?   It ain’t like we ain’t been drunk on boats. We just don’t fall off them motherfuckers.   “Awhhh nawww, I’m going back to the bar.” I stopped—I don’t like cruising to the Caribbean ‘cause all them fucking islands look alike. I don’t even think that boat went no goddamn where.   Just wait for everybody to fall asleep and pulled back in.   “Is this Jamaica?” “Yeah mon, yeah mon.” And you get seasick, so they say take this patch. Put it behind your ear to stop the boat from rocking. Like motherfucker, why don’t you put the patch on the side of the boat? Shit.
I stopped liking cruises when I saw the Titanic . Women think it’s a romantic story. I think it’s dumber than a motherfucker. He fucked that girl one time, had to give her the whole piece of wood. Fuck y’all.   You can have half.   You ain’t even met my mama yet. Fuck you. Shit.
Shit happens I don’t fucking understand man. White folk getting shot at work don’t know what the fuck to do. If you—if you not sure what to do, watch us. When we leave, come, goddamn it. ‘Cause we easing out the building. Look at this crazy motherfucker right here.   This place about to be on the news. Come on Jose   “Si. Si. Si. Si.”   White folk walking right up to the trouble.   “Hey what are you doing here with the camouflage on? Nobody told me it was casual fri—“  We be at home watching the news.   “I was just there. Oh. They done killed the supervisor. I’m applying for the job tomorrow.”
Fuck that shit. We just have different experiences. Like white folk ain’t scared of the police . They talk shit to them.   “Hurry up and write the goddamn ticket, you son of a bitch!   Fucking pig! All this crime going on and you’re fucking with me? There’s a black guy and a Mexican. One of them done something. Goddamn it! Give me your badge number asshoooole.” That shit don’t work for us, do it?   “Give me your – oh   Help me, Jose! No speak-a English. No, no.”   We got a different relationship with the po-lice. You ever had the po-lice follow you so long you get suspicious of your own goddamn self?   “Maybe I did kill them motherfuckers, actually…”
You ever notice the more fucked up you are the better you try to drive? When you real high, you stop 20 feet before the light.   Slip your seat belt on. You got a bottle of liquor on the seat next to you, so you put a seat belt on that motherfucker too.   “Hey if they stop us, act like we ain’t together.” And when you high, everything look like a police car. Don’t it? “Oh shiiiiiit. Check out the police. Hey bitch, take that ski rack off your car.” You done made me our out a bag of weed, fucking with you. Let’s go back Jose.”  “Si. Si. Si. Si.”
Everything’s fucking crazy, now, man. And now we don’t want to know what’s going on in the news, so they anesthetize us with bullshit stories . I mean, Paris Hilton . I don’t even know what the fuck she is famous for? What the fuck did she doooo? ‘Cause her mom and daddy own hotels? You don’t never see them Ramada bitches. You ever see them out?     You don’t see them Motel 6 ho’s, you don’t see them out. And now she going to jail, but I bet she keep her panties on in jail. I bet you that.
I’m so glad Michael Jackson didn’t go to jail.   That’s. That’s one motherfucker ain’t cut out fo’ the penitentiary.   They’d have been passing his ass around like a joint.   “Would you like a hit of the king of pop?” “Why yes, I would.”   I felt bad for the courtroom artist, ‘cause that bitch had to draw Michael Jackson.   And that can’t be easy, ‘cause his color ain’t even in the crayon box.   You gotta mix some shit up to draw Michael Jackson.   “I’m gonna need some peach and some yellow.”  “Are you drawing Michael Jackson?” “Yes I am ho!”
Some motherfuckers ain’t cut out for jail, like Ken Lay . The CEO of, uh, Enron. This motherfucker was supposed to go to jail and pay 30 million dollars. And what’d he do? He died. And uh, that taught me a valuable lesson. If you owe a motherfucker that much money, just die. Fuck that shit.     Shit, I hope when I die the last check I write bounce like a motherfucker.     “Mr. Hughley, there seems to be—     He did it on purpose. That nigger there. Goddamn.”
Maybe that astronaut . This woman found out her man was fucking around so she drove from Texas to, to Florida with a diaper on ‘cause she didn’t have time to stop and shit. Ain’t that somethin’? And what I want to know is, what car you know go 900 miles without stopping for gaaas?   So you’ll stop for gas, but you’ll just shit on yourself? What is that?   “Hey ma’am, can I help you?”   “No, I’m all right.” Somebody needs to change that baby. Shit.   They gonna be selling these to crazy-ass women everywhere. Llaughs)   “Have you ever been on your way to choke a bitch ‘cause you find out she’s fucking your man? All of a sudden, you got to take a shit. Try new AstroDrawers. For the woman on the go with no place to do it.”   I read about this—I remember this skydiving instructor she found out her man was fucking around. She invited the woman he was fucking to go skydiving. And like a dumbass, she went.   And was shocked that the parachute didn’t open up. Just a note fell out that said, “Bye bitch!”   “You must not know about me. You must not.”
I don’t understand. And I’m actually sad when any human being dies. I’m not passing judgment. I’m just telling you how I see it. Now, when five people claim to be your baby daddy, you a ho.   She had more nuts in her than a Snickers bar, that’s all the fuck I’m saying.
Alec Baldwin got in trouble because people got upset because he called his 11-year old daughter a pig.   “I can’t believe that an adult would talk to a child like that.” Are you out of yo fucking mind? Compared to the way we got talked to when we was growing up?   “If you don’t sit down and shut the fuck up, I will knock the shit out of you. Ignorant son of a bitch.   Got me cussing. No I’m saved too. Shit.  Boy you cost me a trip to heaven, I will fuck you up  . I swear to god. I, I’m sorry, Jesus. Amen. Amen.   Please, Lord, don’t let me raise up and choke the fuck out of this motherfucker, please.”
Shit, when I was in third grade, my mama shot me. Ain’t that a bitch?   Yeah with a .22, but it still hurt. I don’t understand it man. These fucking kids , I don’t understand. They’re soft too, man. They’re fucking soft. You leave ‘e in the car in the summer and they die. What type of shit is that?   We got left in the car in the summer and we didn’t die. We had sense enough to get out of the fucking car. It’s hot. We’re in the car. We gonna die. Not me. I’m gonna get out the car.     “Mama said don’t get out.” “I’m taking a whuppin’ but I’m getting out the car. It’s easier to get forgiveness than it is to get permission.” Fuck that shit.
Our mothers use to treat us —oh man. I remember I was 5 years old. I told my mother I was gonna run away.   She went   “don’t nobody want your nappy-headed ass but me. Who the fuck wants you but me?”   Oh, man.
MY mom used to send me to the liquor store when I was 8 years old to get liquor and cigarettes.   “Hey mama, they ain’t gonna give me that shit. I’m 8.” “Hm! Take this note.”   Don’t act like it’s just me. Fuck y’all.
My mom used to have me so stressed out I had to smoke on the way home.   “Oh, shit. I can’t take it.” It’s harder for kids. Teachers are having sex with kids , which I find downright disgusting. They weren’t doing that shit when I was growing up.   I have been denied a good education.  They was fucking like that, I’d have went to school on a Saturday.   “Where you going son?”  “School.” “But it’s Saturday.” “I know Daddy, but they fucking in school.” “Well, let me come down here with you, make sure everything’s all right.”
You never see no sisters. They don’t do that shit. Black female teachers don’t do that shit. A sister is not gonna have sex with no kids. A sister ain’t gonna give no pussy unless you got a job.   “I know you 6, but you better get a paper route or something. This is school. School is for learning. And the first lesson is, pussy costs. Get a job, goddamn it.”
I ain’t never seen so many fat-ass kids in my whole fucking life. How the fuck you 5 and fat? Fat-assed 5-year-old. Fuckin 5 and fat. “Come here.”   “I can’t. I’m five and I’m fat.” You know why they fat? ‘Cause they don’t go outside and play. When was the last time you was driving down the street and kids was outside playing? When we was growing up, we couldn’t go outside, we’d lose our fucking minds. That’s how your mom used to punish you.   “Either I’m gonna whup your ass or you can’t go outside.” You take the whupping like a motherfucker.   You be outside sniffling and playing.   “I’m outside, though.”
These kids are something else, man. And I mean, when I was growing up, every boy, every boy tried to fight his father . It was just a rite of passage. You had to. My father started moving a little slower, and I Uh-huh. I can take this motherfucker. He’s slow. So one day, I tried. I don’t really remember a lot about it.   but I can say he wasn’t as slow as I thought he was.   At one point, I thought I was fighting three motherfuckers.   “How did you get behind me?”And my mother was on the porch cheering him on.   “Fuck him up, Charlie! Fuck him up!” I had to call time-out. Time—time—time-out. I know you exhausted. I am. I am.   And now I see my 18-year-old son looking at me the same way. You know, but he—this motherfucker ain’t never had a fight in his whole goddamn life. I’m, I’m not the first fight you want to have, son. You want to work your way up to me.   Go in there and fight your sisters or something for a while. ‘Cause there ain’t no way in the world I’m gonna let a child of mine kick my ass. And even if you do win, where the fuck you gonna live?   You will be an undefeated, homeless, hungry motherfucker. “I won, but I’m so hungry. I want to go home!”
There were so many things I was never concerned about but now I am, like you know the older you get and the more you look around, you see how the world has changed like global warming never seemed to mean shit to me until a couple of years ago when that tsunami happened, you remember 200,000 people died in that, no animals died, that’s true. Animals sensed what was going on and got the fuck out. And now they tryin to use them for an early warning system, like a chicken gonn tell us what’s goin on.  : “Whats’ wrong boy?” : “You’ll find out”  . Chicken “It’s about to be fucked up around here; Come on Jose” Jose: “si si si si”.
I don’t even know how the fuck you get killed in a tsunami, one of the first signs of a tsunami is that the beach leaves. If I ever go to the beach and the beach ain’t there, then I’m takin my black ass home. People stay and try to figure out “I came all the way to Thailand see the beach and it has the audacity to not be here. I demand that, oh, here it comes”  . Oh my god, that’s a lot of water Jose. Jose?   Screams Jose!
Hurricane Katrina , another example for me of global warming, I was actually in Japan when Hurricane Katrina hit. And I don’t speak Japanese but I kept watching the news and they kept showin people runnin, and they kept sayin refugees, and I said refugees; what the fuck happened in Haiti? It wasn’t refugees, it was American citizens, if you was stealin clothes or food to survive you wasn’t lootin. However that one motha fucka who was pushin that 60 inch plasma t.v. through six feet of water, he was lootin like a motha fucka like, the fuck you stealin a tv while you on tv you dumb son of a bitch. Where the fuck you gonna plug it in at? Whooo that nigga god damn  .
“How come they didn’t’ leave”, that was the biggest question in the country; “they should’ve left, they had plenty of warning they should’ve left”. Well that’s the poorest area of the country, the average income’s about $8000 a year in a lot of parts of new Orleans. That kind of money you ain’t goin no fuckin where, plus black people feel like we got a special relationship with god. “Ima wait on the Lord”. “God gon gimme a sign”, and he will, but you gotta stop lookin for the big shit, the burnin bushes and the rumbling clouds. Sometimes God just sends a weatherman sayin “all this shit right here   “Is about to blow down the street”. That’s from the book of dopplar radar 911 now get in the fuckin car.
The more things I see the more things that amaze me I’m glad to see so many white women out here, it was a rough year for yall, it was a rough couple of years, you couldn’t turn on the news, without a
missing white woman , its just every time.   “Another missing white woman. We go live to bed, bath, and beyond”.  . The first missing white woman was the runaway bride in Georgia, this bitch had the biggest eyes I ever seen in my whole fucking life. You can’t kidnap someone with eyes that big. She’ll see you coming   “You tryin to come kidnap me huh”. “I was, but you saw us now. I read about this one white woman who broke her black husband out of the penitentiary in Tennessee. Ima get me a white woman, fuck y’all shit. You can’t get a sista to pick you up from the airport.   “Ima drive around TWO TIMES, if yo ass ain’t out, I’m about to go”. I got a nail appointment I don’t know who you think you fucking with, what is wrong wich you”.   You know it’s fuckin true man. I can understand it, white women are disappearing at an alarming rate, and between abduction anorexia and black athletes, there ain’t gonna be no more white women left for y’all. Fuck yall, y’all know its true. The only people not laughin at that are white women and black men “Fuck you D.L., that’s not funny”  .
Gas is so high, gas cost more than cocain, ain’t that a bitch. I’m not sayin I know, I’m just telling you its high. Gas is so high, I saw two brothas standin in the drive through.   “Fuck that, I’m…”  “Get off my bumper mother fucker it ain’t…”
I read recently that there were an increase in bear attacks, of course black people tend to not know that, because, we tend to not get attacked by bears. Get attacked by a bear you gotta go to the woods, and we ain’t go to the woods. If you dun see a black man in the woods, something dun gone horribly wrong. A bear wouldn’t even know what the fuck we was.   “What is that” “I don’t know, but he sure is fast” “Do you smell weed?” “HUH, that’s that nigga der god damn fuck”.
Whole lotta shit I don’t understand man. The abortion issue is raised again, I’m not gonna say whether I’m for or against abortion, what I’m against is a bunch of men sitting around the white house deciding what women should do with they bodies, that’s the fuck I’m against. That ain’t got shit to do with you. Cus the big question is, when does life begin, at conception or when the babies an embryo; anybody with kids know that they life don’t begin till they can pay they own fuckin bills. Until then you just a motha fucka livin off me. I’m confused by people who generally claim to be pro life, cus they generally are against abortion but for the death penalty and for war, which is kinda fuckin confusing to me. “Yeah we want the baby to grow up, that way WE can kill him”. Its amazing how Christian we claim to be but we do things the opposite of what/ the way Christ asked us to, you ever notice that? Like we always, I was driving down the street through Virginia and I saw two bumper stickers, one that said “I support the NRA”, right next to that was another bumper sticker said “what would Jesus do” Ain’t that a bitch. I ain’t no bible scholar but I’ma guess he ain’t gonna have a gun. I mean I remember when he was being crucified he said “forgive them for they do not know what they do”, not “when I get down from here Ima pop a cap in you motha fuckas. I talk all the shit I want cause I know I’m goin to hell. Can’t be no hotter than Washington in the summer time god damn. Shit. It was so hot today I knew I couldn’t have been a slave fuck yall shit. I’d be telling them “master let me and I’m thinkin they planning to escape, its hotter than a motha fucka. Huh gimme some lemondade and I’ll draw you a map, it’s hot”  . “I need to eat please, help. What I love to see is men and women out together cus women get drunk and try to pretend like they don’t know what the fuck they did   “Did I do something”  “you sho did”  “gimme a kiss”  “you must be out yo fuckin mind. We not kissin no more this week. I know where yo mouth been nasty ass.”   “Every time I drink with you my ass hurts.”   “Maybe you fell; you should check your balance”. I’ve been married for 21 years, you know what I’ve come to realize, you can’t be the same man you were before you got married, you gotta give some shit up. It’s incumbent for a man to sacrifice, to to to to a uhh, successful relationship, you gotta sacrifice, you gotta give some shit up. You gotta give up hope. Hope is a single man’s game, don’t no married man need no hope. Say you driving home this lovely woman, “oh I hope she cooks”, she didn’t’. “Hope she ain’t mad”, she is. “Hope I can get some head”, you won’t! A married woman stop giving head the minute she say I do.   “I do, now I don’t have to suck any dick anymore, thank God  . Married women give head with other shit on they minds  “Hurry up I gotta take my cornbread out”. I hate valentine’s day, that’s the dumbest fucking holiday in the god damn world, I gotta give you flowers for the same pussy I was getting from you the night before for free, what kinda shit is that? And edible panties wasn’t meant for each and every one of y’all, some of y’all got too much ass ain’t no way in the fuck you can finish all them draws. They get mad   “you ain’t gonna finish?”   “girl I’m full now, shit. I need a nap and a doggy bag. Wrap it up I’ll carry it with me to work tomorrow.” Some brotha warmed it up in the break room microwave     “What you eatin”   “Some draws I didn’t finish last night”. The more prettier a woman is the more bullshit you’ll put up with, pretty women get away with fuckin murder. A pretty woman could start crying here right now, every man would say “girl you alright”? Ooh I hate to see a pretty girl like you cryin. Ugly girls catch hell when they cryin cus ain’t nobody give a fuck.   “auuahhhhh” hey girl, get away from my car. Don’t make me throw another rock at you, get the fuck away from my car.  . Women love a man that can make them laugh, you can make a woman laugh, you can have any woman you want, that’s fuckin true. Brothas be mean “cook me some breakfast bitch.”   “You never make me laugh anymore”.   “Cook me some breakfast bitch HaHA.” Don’t try that at home, I was just fuckin around, now some of y’all…  .
They say the biggest problem with men and women is that we have problems communicating, and I can understand that because, uh, men and women come from two different worlds. Men come from the world that’s here, women come from a fuckin world they make up. You ever gonn hold a conversation with your woman and you tried to understand her, and halfway through the conversation you go “what the fuck are you talking about?   I don’t even understand what you sayin.” You know what I’m sayin, you don’t even know what the fuck you sayin, do you? Women do shit that is certifiedly insane. Putting towels in a fucking bathroom ain’t nobody been to fucking use, what kind of shit is that?   “Don’t use those towels”   “Well what are they in there for”   “THERE NOT FOR YOU!” Everytime I get out of the shower I rub my dick across those towels, fuck those towels. I don’t give a shit about these goddamn towels. And you know why we’re laughing, cus we all do it, that’s why.  . Women come in the bathroom   “Do these towels smell funny to you? They smell like nuts”. The only thing worse than taking a shower with a women is taking a fuckin bath, you motha fucka’s run the water 25 degrees higher than we can handel it. “What did you set this motha fucka on, hell? To you it’s romantic, to me its like boiling hotdogs, this shit hurts” You see how long it takes us to sit in the tub   “uhh, uhhhh, uhhhhhh, ay girl stop splashin, stop splashin, stop fuckin around. My nuts are on fire”.   “how come you stop talking to me after we finish makin love?” Cus something in pussy makes you sleepier than a motha fucker that’s why. You get some pussy, you can’t stay awake.  “What’d she put in here? What is it, an ambient in here or something? I can’t keep my eyes open“. You get some pussy and eat a turkey sandwich, you in a comma,   “I think she’s tryin to kill me. I gotta lay downawnan”   They fucking hate when we use their toothbrush, what’s that shit about huh?   “DON’T USE MY TOOTHBRUSH! THAT’S NASTY!”   “After the shit we was doin to eachother last night? That was nasty, I had my face in your ass, what the fuck are you talking about?”   “I don’t care. That’s Nasty.” And they fuckin hate when we leave the toilet seat up, boy they hate that shit. I never even understood why, but do you understand they fall they whole ass in the bottom of the bowl? Feet dangling over they edge? Two oclock in the morning all you hear is   “GOD DAMMIT!!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN FLUSH YOU NASTY SON OF A BITCH! I’m so tired of my ass being wet I don’t know what the fuck to do!” That shit cracks me up I do it on purpose. You know how hard it is to put the toilet seat down, two oclock in the morning you stagger to the bathroom with that hard dick that won’t bend? You just…  . All of a sudden your shit splits three different ways, you…   Thank god we got these towels right here  . Oh well  . Don’t act like it’s just me, fuck y’all.
Women love to spend time with you, but only with the shit that they wanna do. Oh and they wanna do some boring shit.   “Let’s get up in the morning, we’ll go to breakfast, and then we’ll go to Costco”.   “The fuck do I wanna go to Costco for, I don’t wanna go to fucking Costco. Let’s stay home and drink some wine and watch some porno.”   “NO! We goin to Costco”. Women love Costco cus they get that membership card and think they got all the power.   “He with me, come on you can come in”  . You can get shit at Costco you don’t even fuckin need. “OOO a helicopter seat. I’ll put this shit in my car”. I guess it’s good that y’all pick the itinerary for the day, cus if we did it’d be the same shit.   “Look here baby, you’ve been askin me about spending some time together, so I want you to know I heard you, you gonna get up, then you gonna make some breakfast, and then you gonna give me some pussy, and then we gonna lay down and take a nap, and when we wake up you gonna make some more lunch, and then you gonna give me some pussy. And then the game gonna come on, and we gonna be quiet”. And all the men are going “That’s a good ass day!”. The women are going “fuck you, we’re going to Costco.”  .
Ever tried to talk your woman into watching porno? They lose their god damn mind.   “You like that shit?”   “I sho do”. Porno ain’t nothin but a love story with all the words taken out. My wife walked caught me watchin porno   “What the fuck are you doing?”   “You know good and god damn well what I’m doing.”   “Are you thinking about me?”   “Fuck no you in the next room! I thought you was goin to Costco! Take this helicopter seat back it don’t work.”
I don’t know man. I was readin about stem cell research man and apparently the president vetoed this because he believes that the stem cells are for future life. But I can guarantee you, if you could prove stem cells could enlarge the size of a man’s dick that shit would pass tomorrow.   “He has Alzheimer’s he won’t remember anything”  “He’ll remember how big his dick is, you see the size of the dick on this guy?” “He’s paralyzed he can’t walk”  “But his dick is so big he can push the button on the wheelchair with it are you fuckin crazy?”
The greatest medical development in the last 10 years has been erectile dysfunction drugs, that’s the fuckin deal. And they originally weren’t for your dick, they were originally experimental heart medications. Some dude walks in “huhh, my chest hurts”   “Here, take this pill. How’s the chest”   “It hurts but my dick is hard as a mother fucker”   “What about the chest?”   “Fuck the chest give me two more pills”. And they say that shit can make you blind, ain’t that a bitch if you finally get your dick hard and you can’t even see your woman “Sheila?.. I don’t care my dick is so big I can use it for a cane”  . “That’s the garage”.  .
They got this shit called Cialis, shit lasts 36 hours, 36 hours of fuckin, that ain’t fun. You’ll just be chap and dehydrated.   “You ready to go again big daddy?”   “Girl get the fuck away from me. Bring me some Gatorade and some baby powder. My nuts are on fire. First that bath, now this, this shit is painful”. Cialis got the dumbest warnings in the world   “If you have an erection for more than four hours, you should call a doctor”. If I got an erection for more than four hours Ima call a hooker, I don’t know about you. My momma always said share your toys.
Got some shit called Avitra and one of the side effects can cause penis disfigurement, that really ain’t worth the risk, cause you will not get a lot of action when your dick’s shaped like a yam.   That don’t turn the ladies on, ya… You know they gonna ask you   “Why’s your dick shaped like a yam?”   “Just call me sweet potato pie baby”.  .

Are you on some medication or some shit? This motha fucka driftin off like it’s a methadone clinic   What’s this, a field trip you on or somethin? And look at you, don’t look away because that not gonna stop me from fuckin with you ya   “Don’t look at him. If you don’t look at him, he can’t see you. Everyone knows that”.   Y’all married or just fuckin around?   Are you alright? You must push on doors that say pull, huh   “How come everybody get in but me?” Ima leave your ass alone, I know something is wrong with you.  How you doin, y’all together? Look at that, white dude, black woman huhhhh. Uhh huhhh. And they tryin to pretend like they ain’t with each other   “I don’t know you”.   “I don’t know you!”   You been to a family reunion yet? Aww you gonna have a ball.   “Ayy uh, snowflake, snowflake, lemme hold $20 snowflake, don’t be like that”  . You gotta go, it’s gonna be funna then a motha fucka. What do you do cat daddy?   “I’m a bartender”. Oh that’s how   that’s how you met her  .   “You want another long island baby, here you go baby”.   “Ooh, that shit is NICE”.

How you doin tight shirt, you alright? I know you uncomfortable than a motha fucka, you. Every time you breath, you pop a button or something. Now what do you do big man?   “I work for a law firm”.   You work for a law firm? You’re not a lawyer are you?   “Your honor, I would like to make a motion for dismissal, at least a recess, I have to loosen up my shirt”.  . Ima leave yo ass alone, fuck around and jump on me, none of yall won’t do shit. It’ll be on the news tonight   “Today, there was an assault on comedian D.L. Hughley, there was no description of.. what… this coming in… I believe the suspect was wearing a, uh, body suit”  . You know black people gonna see it “HEY BODY SUIT!” So you married?  .
