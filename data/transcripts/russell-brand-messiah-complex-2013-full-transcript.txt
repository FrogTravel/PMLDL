 Ladies and gentlemen… Russell Brand. Dum-dum-dum – the news Here comes the news I’ve got some views I’m going to fuck you in the mind with a cock of news Gonna ejaculate current affairs into your eyes Because of that, I felt of sort of agitated and irritated – and nervous – when I was going in there. – I had the demeanor and, – to a degree, Facial expression, that my cat has if you try to gently submerge him in water. – Let’s have a look at – the footage. Could we do more to break their addiction or is their compulsion just too strong? The recovering drug addict and comedian Russell Brand… “Here to tell us that drugs are just harmless fun “is this pie-eyed Charles Manson Rasputin figure.” I’ll tell you what’s really bad. I remember that moment. I remember the camera being on me and the red light coming on that indicates that they’re filming. And I remember thinking, oh, the camera’s on you, Russell. Come on, just do a normal face. You can do it. – You’re as good – as the other boys. You can do this. Looks like I’m thinking a very high-pitched noise. – It’s like I’m trying to break – the sound barrier with my mind. People laugh at me. They laughed at me. Yeah. ‘Cause of my unconventional appearance, my great hair, cool beard, my philosophy was ignored. – Now any of you that – have been listening will know That that is exactly what happened to Che Guevara. Che Guevara is a man so successfully extracted from his image that at this point in time, he can be used as an exhibition for cars to promote their product. Have a look at that. That’s Che Guevara at a Mercedes exhibition. They’ve replaced the star on his beret with the Mercedes logo. Yeah, he’d be fine with that, Che Guevara. Not like he drove corporations out of Cuba at gunpoint or anything. I don’t want to belabor the point, but Mercedes is another one of the companies that made stuff for the Nazis. I can’t get too deep into after the whole Hugo Boss debacle. How come I get in more trouble for saying that they made stuff for the Nazis than they did for making stuff for the Nazis? Seems like a weird scale. Che is not alone among my heroes in being posthumously appropriated for corporate end. Here’s a photograph of Gandhi advertising Apple Computers. “Be the change you wish to see in the world.” I can’t imagine that the change that Gandhi would wish to see in the world would be iPhones getting thinner and thinner and thinner and thinner and thinner and thinner – until you don’t know whether to – make a phone call – Or put some – cheese on it and fucking eat it. I can’t imagine that Gandhi would approve of the iPhone factory in China where working conditions were so bad that the people that work there, they were jumping out of the windows of the building and killing themselves and management solved that problem by putting nets up around the building. – I’d like to – have been at that meeting. “It’s happened again, boss.” “Ugh. – “That’s the fourth bloody – suicide this week. We’ve got to do something.” – “I’m so glad you’ve said that – because I’ve got a plan, right? “What we could do is pay the workers a proper amount of – “money, maybe – give them a pension plan. I thought maybe a Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.” “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. – “You’re really – over-thinking this. Put some fucking nets up.” Also, what do you say to someone who’s made the decision to jump off of a building and end their life when you’re getting them down from the net? “Oi, you. “Come on. “Down from the net. “Back to work. – “That counts – as your tea break. “It’s fun on there, it’s like a big trampoline. “Stop crying. “Get in there. Make them thinner.” “That’s not my department.” That ain’t the change that Gandhi would wish to see in the world. Unless maybe his wife worked at that factory. “Go on then, love.” – “You’re going to jump next, – ain’t you, Gandhi?” – “Oh, yeah, yeah, – I’ll be right behind you. Fuck off.” Why are they doing this to us? Why are they positioning our heroes in these meaningless landscapes? Why are they creating a cultural malaise – in which – nothing has nutrition, Where our food lacks nutrition, where there’s an emptiness in my stomach that can’t be filled by drugs or fame or money? Who is that benefits from this system? Who is that benefits from us having a void within ourselves that can never be filled? Who is that claims that they can fill this void? – Well, it’s people like this guy, – isn’t it? I never trusted him. – I never trusted him – when I was a kid. He’s the Jimmy Savile of corporate logos. I don’t like the idea of buying food from someone whose mouth looks like a horizontal vagina. Look at this stuff, man. – “M,” – registered trademark. I’m lovin’ it. Registered trademark. – How can “M” be a registered – trademark? That is one of our letters. – What am I supposed to do – if I need a word What’s got an “M” in it? Use a “B” on its side? – You “banipulative” – “boney-grabbing,” “botherfuckers.” – Also, check this slogan: – I’m lovin’ it. We heard it a thousand times. I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it. But what does it mean? What does it mean? Well, they’ve dropped the “G,” interestingly, and apostrophized it because then it seems colloquial. They’re our friends. – Hey, I’m lovin’ it, – we’re lovin’ it. – We’re all – just the same. You can trust us. Also, by dropping the “G,” they make it colloquial – and therefore, – it can be owned. They can trademark it if it’s not a conventional piece of English language. Most importantly, though, by dropping the “G” and making it colloquial, it distracts us from the actual, literal meaning of the verb to love in the continuous form. I’m lovin’ it. The act of love. – ‘Cause I don’t think – McDonald’s would want us to have The image of Ronald McDonald in the act of love with his hard, thin, white clown cock, tapering towards the end, and his bright red pubes, sliding into a Filet-O-Fish. I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it, I’m lovin’ it. What are you loving, Ronald, with your fat-saturated food deliberated marketed at young people? Obese schoolboys… So you can waddle after them in – your clown shoes and fuck ’em, – you painted nonce? – I don’t mind a little bit of – hyperbole, – But these people – are going to town. – There’s actually a product that – I quite like… Dr Pepper. But unbelievably satisfying? That is a bold claim for a brown, fizzy drink. Unbelievably satisfying! – What does that even – fucking look like? – “Are you enjoying – that beverage?” “I’ll say I am! “It’s unbelievably satisfying. – “I’m going to have to – recategorize my understanding of “satisfaction to incorporate the experience I’ve just had. “I can’t believe how satisfied I am and I am me. “So who is it that’s satisfied – “and who is it that – can’t believe it? – It’s a fucking paradox – in a can is what I’m drinking.” If we’re using words like “unbelievably satisfying” to describe a brown, fizzy drink, what language is left for love? – “What was it like when you – looked into her eyes at the site “of the canal beneath the orange streetlamp? – “What was it like when you – realized in that moment – That perhaps you could – love again?” “Oh, yeah, that was unbelievably satisfying actually.” What language is left for God? – “What was it like when you – realized that your consciousness – “is invisibly interconnected – with all consciousness – “and there is no separation, – that we are all one, – “that we can change – our reality at any moment With a simple decision?” “Oh, you know, that was unbelievably satisfying.” – “What was it like when you drank – that Dr Pepper?” “Oh, hm, my teeth hurt a little bit.” – That is a more – realistic slogan. My teeth hurt a little bit. Or… or maybe the problem can be solved with a comma. Unbelievably comma… given the shit we put in it… satisfying. But you’d be hard-pushed to top our friends over at Gillette with their slogan… “Gillette. The best a man can get.” Is it? Shaving? Type of shaving. Well, I am a man and I’ve shaved before. So I’m just gonna offer this up there. Um, you know, shaving’s good, but have you ever been in a situation – with one person, they’re here, – and they’re Sucking your cock – and there’s another person here – and they’re putting Their tongue into your bottom? It’s better than shaving. Don’t set the bar so fucking low. – Though if you are – going to do that, – It is polite to have a little – shave first. Hmm… If a product has an advertisement it means you don’t need it. No one ever has to say, “Go to sleep. “Breathe. Love people.” – If they’re advertising it, – you don’t need it. Why are they doing this? – Why are they confusing us – with this erroneous, – Duplicitous – information all the time? This hyperbole, these lies, these meaningless claims, these peculiar offers? – Well, it’s obviously for money, – isn’t it, But they’ve got so much. – How much money – do they need? – All of the money, – all of it. Do you know there are 147 interconnected corporations that control half of the world’s wealth? That’s not very many, 147. That’s just that little back paddock there. Maybe we should just let them maraud throughout our planet and do what they want. And we could if it were not for things like global poverty and world hunger, stains on our collective soul. World hunger could be solved with $40 billion of investment. I know that sounds like a lot, but not compared to the $50 trillion controlled by American millionaires, $11 trillion of which is held in offshore bank accounts. Now I don’t know what an offshore bank account means – but it sounds a bit like – a beach. – Sounds like they’ve – got so much fucking money, They’ve sent some to go on fucking holiday somewhere. – The relationship between those – two figures, Of having that much money – and not using it to alleviate – the problem Is like having 500 quid in your pocket… Right, if I had 500 quid in my pocket and a starving child said, “Can I have 40 pence please?” Going, “No, fuck off! “500’s a round number, I need it. This money’s going on holiday.” Ha-ha-ha-ha! How can this story be maintained? How is that narrative succeeded? I suppose because it’s remained uninterrupted by better storytellers. Men like Malcolm X who said that people’s rights have to change and be acknowledged by any means necessary. Whatever it takes, whatever it takes. That’s what we’ll do. Whatever it takes. – Malcolm X, – a very great hero, Altered the narrative of his people. – Who taught you – to hate your hair? – Who taught you to hate the color – of your skin? My favorite Malcolm X story – involves the arrest of – Joseph Hinton. – Whenever anyone was – arrested in Harlem, His parish, Malcolm X would go to advocate for their release. – On this particular day in – Harlem, – When he was – in the police station, A crowd gathered outside as is often the case when Brother Malcolm would go somewhere. And there was that hot, febrile atmosphere that it can sometimes be before a riot. – You know, when it can go either – way at football, Or a street protest. I like that feeling. – Not ’cause I think that… I want – people to get hurt Or things to get smashed, – although I don’t mind things – getting smashed A little bit sometimes. I just like that feeling that reality isn’t permanent, that things aren’t permanent, – that they can be disrupted – and changed, – Even in very – trivial situations, Very trivial examples. – Like when I was at school, – you know, when you’re at school And you’re at your desk – and you’re doing your work – and through the window You see that a dog has come in the playground. “There’s a dog in the playground!” – The teachers don’t – want you to see it. Shut the fucking curtains. – “There’s a dog in – the playground! – “There’s a dog – in the playground! “Fuck algebra, fuck the police! “You can’t control us, there’s a dog in the playground! Nothing’s real!” I like it. – I like the disruption – of what’s normal. That’s why I go to riots. – I don’t go – so much now. I used to go to more protest riots, call them what you will. I got a good one. – This story – you will like it. But it involves some public nudity, so before I tell you it, there are two things that are very, – very important – for you to bear in mind. One, I was on a lot of drugs at the time, okay? And two, it was very, very cold that day. It was in SoHo. – There’s a huge crowd of – protestors. I’m part of that crowd and it’s that vibe of – oh my God, it’s – going to fucking kick off. I’m excited and I’m enjoying it, – but I’m not – the center of attention And it doesn’t seem right. I see in the distance a police van. – I think if I get – on that police van, – I’ll be the fucking center – of attention. – So I hustle through the crowd, – get on top of the police van. – Sure enough, – the crowd roars. “Yes!” Like Mick with Usher. Just the visibility is enough sometimes. “Yes, go on, that bloke” is the sort of feeling, – that it’s a positive – thing I’m doing. – So I feel I’ve got to keep – these people entertained. – I’ve got to keep their interest – sustained. And what do I do? – Like even in that – Olympic photograph, – I take my – fucking top off, right? So I just rip my top off. – The crowd goes, – “Yes!” – Like that… – They’re really into it. It’s a proud moment for me. Oh, fuck, I’ve not told you something really important. Malcolm X successfully negotiates the release of Joseph Hinton. – As the two emerge from – the police station, The crowd looked to Malcolm X to ascertain is this a situation for conflict or acquiescence? Malcolm X raises his hand and with a single hand gesture, the crowd immediately disperses. – Single hand gesture, – that’s all it took. – Everyone just – dropped it and went home. A New York City police officer observing that day said, “That is too much power for one man to have.” Back to me! – I’m on top of the van, – I’ve took my top off, – And I’m hearing – the crowd fucking loving it. “Go on!” – I think I’ve gotta keep these – people entertained. Take down my trousers. “Yes, go on, mystery man,” they’re saying. – I figured I’d just – take this to the nth degree, – Let’s take it to – the next level. I pull down my underpants, wave them above my head as a flag of anti-capitalism, a flag of triumph. Power to the people! Revolution! – About this point, I notice that – everyone in the crowd Has gone really quiet, right? I seem sort of embarrassed. I look down to the direction of their stare and I gotta tell you, right? – Some women – don’t know this. The male penis has an enormous capacity for variance in size. And he did not show up for me that day. It was really bad. Really bad. It looked like they were was a bald patch in my pubes. Honestly. – It was really… you know that – nightmare you have where you’re Naked in public at a riot on a police van with an imaginary cock? That… That happened! That’s my life! I was up there fucking freaked out, so I tried to just like wank it into a normal size, which is a sex crime. Indecent exposure, which is still on my criminal record. – Even the wanking was kind of – embarrassing. Not proper wanking, you know? It was like putting a Smurfs hat on, then taking it off again. – Smurf hat on, – Smurf hat off. Smurf hat on, Smurf hat off. So embarrassed, man. But I tell you, as soon as my hand went to my cock, that crowd began to disperse. It was like I was able to disperse an entire crowd with a single hand gesture. So in a way… I’m a little bit like Malcolm X. Malcolm X is obviously not a perfect human being and therefore flawed. – Served a lot of time – for drug dealing And for pimping women. Che Guevara, not perfect in spite of successfully – overthrowing a government – in his early 30s. – Apparently didn’t – change his shirts very much And smelled a bit. Disappointing, isn’t it, to find that out about Che Guevara. These men all represented the people’s interest against a visible, identifiable enemy. How would they cope now with our amorphous, unknowable foes when evil comes named after innocent fruit with the white beaming face of the clown hidden behind unknowable numbers and baffling words like “derivatives” and “bundles”? How would these men confront an evil that isn’t obvious and labeled? In the old days, history came up, tagged up with swastikas and obvious. Even in a picture of him as a child, I’ll bet you’ll recognize this man. – Right, you know – who that is, do you? Even at 10? Yeah. – Actually, it’s not me, – it’s actually Hitler but… Same basic personality type. Let’s look at Hitler as a 10-year-old boy before the abuse and torture he endured as a child, before the horrors he witnessed in the First World War, before the anti-Semitism – that swept across that part of – Europe and corrupted him And influenced him. – If you look into the eyes of – that 10-year-old boy, A 10-year-old Hitler, you can see that he’s already a right little bastard. At 10! Look at… “Take the photo, you pig dog. I’ll have you killed.” He’s already got two henchmen, also. “Yes, mein Fuhrer. – He is a poor – photographer.” My favorite thing though about this photo is that kid there, down in front of him. Look at his little face. – That is exactly the expression – I’d have if I knew that Adolf Hitler was right behind me. “Is he still there?” “Yeah, seriously. Adolf Hitler is right behind you, mate.” “I know.” “Don’t worry. He’s more scared of you than you are of him.” “I don’t think so.” That little kid, curiously enough, by some extraordinary quirk of fate is the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, the logician and thinker who continues to influence philosophy to this day. – Incredibly important – philosopher. Isn’t it amazing that in Austria, in one school, in one class, you have the best philosopher of the day and the worst dictator in history? You gotta feel sorry for the teacher of that class. “How’s work today, dear?” “Mmm. Another tough one, actually.” – “Oh really? – What happened?” “Well, okay. – “Just a couple – of examples. “Um. One kid said to me, ‘If you consider, Miss'”… – And that’s weird, ’cause I’m – a bloke, so that threw me… “‘If you consider, Miss, eternity not to be “‘an infinite temporal duration, “‘but the quality of timelessness, “does eternity belong to those who live in the present?’ “So that was tricky. – “A couple of paintings, – this little one now, – “fucking thinking about it all – through lunch. “Couldn’t really get me head around it. “Then there’s another kid, “just keeps asking me if I’m Jewish. “I’m worried about that boy. “He’s pushy, I don’t like him. “A lot to say, opinionated child. “Mind you, he’s a very enthusiastic student. “I will say that. Always got his hand up in class.” Oh yes, yes. Literally Sieg Heiling. You see that cross above Hitler’s head? Do you think that was done by a gleeful archivist? “Oh my God, I found a picture of Wittgenstein and Hitler in one class and what a break…” Or do you think it was Hitler’s teacher when Hitler left school… – “Watch out for this – little cunt.” What terrifies me more than the extremity of Hitler is the mundanity of Hitler. You know, not the terrible Holocaust or the horrific Second World War, but that Hitler is actually just a normal bloke. Hitler had an older sister called Paula. Paula Hitler. Paula Hitler. “Paula! You’ve used all the hot water!” “Oh, what are you gonna do?” “I will have revenge and ultimate power.” It’s the mundanity of Hitler that’s terrifying. He’s just a normal man, – just a normal person – like any of us. You know that in terms of our DNA, we are 98% identical to a chimpanzee. If we’re 98% identical to a chimpanzee, how different can we be from each other? Baffling idea. Do you know that 60% of human DNA is in a fruit fly? Those fruit flies, them idiots, you move fruit… they come up. – How do they get in there? – I hate them. – 60% of our DNA – is the same as them. 100% of my DNA is in my cat. But that’s because I get lonely sometimes. Oh. Oh. – Oh, come, Russell, have a good – laugh about Hitler, But don’t fuck the cat. – Well, he shouldn’t have such – a prominent anus then. Second-most noticeable thing about him. Tail up in the air like a little furry fuck handle. 82% of human DNA is identical to the DNA in the feline species. 50% of human DNA is found in a banana. A stupid yellow crescent moon banana. So if someone says, “Hey, is that a banana in your pocket – or are you just – pleased to see me?” Say, “What difference does it make? “Just pop it in your mouth. – “Be careful with – the skin. – Why don’t you – find the day…” So if our heroes are all flawed and our villains are just mundane people like us, what can we believe in with impunity? Jesus Christ? – Surely we can – believe in Jesus. – Well, yeah, of course we can, – but which Jesus? ‘Cause I don’t want to believe in the Jesus Christ of the neo-Conservative right of Fox News, of Rupert Murdoch or the “Daily Mail,” that bigoted homophobic Jesus, the Jesus that they’ve manufactured to prop up their authoritarian ideas. – Like check this picture, right, – of Jesus that we was Mucking about with earlier. This is actually an image of Constantine the emperor who converted to Christianity in 325 AD fused with Sol Invictus, the Roman sun god that the people previously worshipped. So their allegiance would now be referred to this new Messianic figure who was associated with their leader. That’s why, look, that halo, the sun, that’s leftover from Sol Invictus. – There’s no mention of Jesus – wandering around with a halo in The fucking Bible. – “Thanks for the fishes – and loaves. – What’s – the fucking light bulb?” It’s not in there. They added that on to make the Romans think, “Oh yeah, he’s all right, he’s basically the same.” – You know, – Jesus seems really lovely, What I’ve read in the Bible. – Everything He says – seems kind of cool. Love thy neighbor as you love thyself. Give to the poor, receive treasure in heaven. The kingdom of heaven is within. Sounds all right, doesn’t it? Sounds sort of like a hippie Commie gay type of a guy. So where is this Jesus – of the far right – fucking coming from, Who’s really bothered about homophobia? In America, from listening to the neo-Conservative right, – you’d think – that’s all He cared about. Like, “Don’t be gay!” You’d think it was called “The Bible: Don’t Be a Fucking Poof.” Like… It’s not in there. – There’s one little bit in – Leviticus. – Don’t lay down – with another man. It’s not like a central thing. You’d think if Jesus was that concerned about homosexuality He had the perfect opportunity to address the issue in His top 10 do’s and don’ts. Put it in there. – Number 10: – Don’t be gay. Nip it in the bud. It’s not in there. No mention of the old “gayness” in the anus. As far as the 10 Commandments are concerned, homosexuality is not considered as important an issue as thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s oxen. So if you’re in a situation where you’re really buzzed up and you’ve gotta do something sinful for relief, Jesus would prefer it if you had gay sex to you coveting your neighbor’s oxen. “Jesus, I had a terrible day at work. – “I’m either going to – fuck this geezer in the ass – Or I’m gonna – covet my neighbor’s oxen.” – “Well, don’t do that, – you better… ” “Thanks, Jesus. – “I’m going to slide my hard cock – up into his ass, My balls banging on his balls.” – “Yeah, yeah, yeah, do what you – gotta do, mate. “Just don’t look over next door’s fence “at that oxen, then imagine in your mind “what it would be like if that oxen was your oxen. – Don’t do that, – will you?” “No, no, no, I won’t. – “I’m going to come in his – asshole. – “I’m going to suck my – come out of his ass, “kiss him with rivers of cum connecting our lips… “cum bubbles floating off into the sky like a homosexual snowstorm.” – “Yeah, yeah, – yeah, yeah, yeah. “Do what you gotta do, mate. Just remember, that is not your oxen.” So you have to download homophobic Jesus from media outlets like Fox News in America. Fox News is like “Daily Mail” live. I don’t like that Fox News. Not only is Fox News bigoted, it’s also misleading. – I once watched – it for 12 hours And there was not one story about foxes. – “A fox in a waistcoat – rescued a boy from a well.” – Just stories about immigrants, – really. – Not even stories, – just shouting. “Immigrants! “Immigrants! Immigrants!” All right. What? “Immigrants!” You know that an immigrant is just someone who used to be somewhere else. “Ahh! Have you always been there?” – “No, no, no, – I used to be over there.” “Ahh! “Keep still! “I can’t relax with people moving around. “Keep still on this spherical rock “in infinite space. – “Keep still on – the spherical rock – “with imaginary geopolitical – borders “that have been drawn in according to the economic “reality of the time. “Do not pause to reflect that free movement of global capital “will necessitate free movement of a global labor force to meet – “the demands created by the free – movement of that capital. “That is a complex economic idea “and you won’t understand it. “Just keep still on the rock. “And don’t be gay on it! “Gays! There are gays!” “What?” “Gays.” “What about them?” “There are them.” – “What are you – worried about?” “What if they do a gay marriage?” “I don’t know.” “Well, it’s a bit gay!” – “Yeah, I – think it’s a bit gay. – Yeah, shouldn’t worry, – I don’t think it affects you.” An astronomer told me once… – And this is in his jurisdiction, – so we can trust him. He said, “Russell, you will never understand the vastness “of the Milky Way, the galaxy that we live in. “It’s too big to conceptualize in your little, little mind. “So just imagine for a moment “that the Milky Way was the size of Great Britain, “then 30 times the size of Great Britain. “If that was our solar system… “Mars, Venus, us, you remember from school… “would fit into a single teacup somewhere in Croydon. “There are 400 million “known galaxies in our universe. “How can you know that “and then care if someone sticks their cock “up someone else’s ass? These are not the black holes we need to concern ourselves with.” It’s hard to live without meaning in infinite space when Nietzsche has said that God is dead, when Chesterton has proved that we’ll believe in anything, when Gillette say that the best a man can get is a type of shave, when Dr Pepper tells us we should be unbelievably satisfied with a brown drink, what’s left to believe in when our heroes are flawed, when our villains are mundane? What can unite all of us together, what can we all share? What can unify us against the tyranny and the oppression, the fear, the loneliness and the emptiness? What’s left for us? – God? – Can we believe in God? – Well, I do, but you’re not – going to trust me. – I’ve proved over – the course of the evening I’m a fucking lunatic. But Einstein, we can trust Einstein, can’t we, who, when asked if he was religious, responded, “Well, there are forces in this universe “that I will never understand “and I hold these forces in great reverence and to that degree, I am religious.” I suppose what Einstein is saying is that the realm of the senses is limited and prohibited in any judgments we make within that tiny little limited realm. I’m not of any actual fucking value. With our sensory perception, for our sight, an optic level, we can only see between infrared light and ultraviolet light. There are thousands of rays of cascading light invisible to us, all around us. We have a limited decibel range that we can hear. We can’t hear the sound of a dog whistle. We can’t hear the sound of me thinking on the news… Thank God. How would we conceptualize smell if none of us had it? – If that concept was inaccessible – through lack of Sensory instrument of the nose? – How would we understand – the difference between The smell of paint and bacon – and Che Guevara’s – shirts? – It would be – meaningless to us. But just because we don’t have the information, that doesn’t mean the information isn’t there, that there aren’t frequencies, energy, interconnected prism… Because we can’t see it that don’t mean it ain’t there. Us not knowing about something – don’t mean that the thing – doesn’t exist. My cat doesn’t know there’s an Internet. There’s an Internet. “Meow. “I don’t know. I’m too sexy.” “Yes, you are. “Come here. – And now another – quick dip.” – That’s why I think – we need stories that Are tied to permanent phenomenon. Stories that can’t be forgotten or submerged. The Celtic people that used to occupy these islands, revered the rivers, – thought the rivers – were sacred. So that would prevent them – from ever being disrespectful – to the rivers Or polluting the rivers. The Nordic people thought their ancestors were in the trees, so mass-deforestation wasn’t an option. The Native American people believed that God is in the soil. How then would you feel about fracking? No wonder these stories have been rewritten and forgotten. No wonder our heroes have been replaced by sequin-covered vacuous fools. You can’t have a society with these kinds of members because these men rewrite history. You can’t have a man with a brain like Gandhi, a heart like Che Guevara, the courage of Malcolm X. – I’m aware that these are – the qualities of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion are looking for in “The Wizard of Oz.” That doesn’t undermine them. All I’m saying is I’m glad that I have these heroes that represent values outside of our popular culture and I urge all of you to choose heroes as well – because if you – don’t choose heroes, Heroes will be chosen for you and they will not represent values that empower you but powers that enslave you, ideas that enslave you. – I’m not saying this is – something you have to deal with Immediately now, like, “Fuck, I better get a hero! You, Russell!” No. – That’s not why I’ve gathered – you all here. It’s not going to turn into a rally. Everyone take your clothes off! – Let’s fuck each other, – it’s cool now! Whoo! – “But I’m here with – my mum! Sorry, it’s what he wanted.” My mum’s here as well, don’t freak out. My mum’s here listening to that come river… that bit. Just thinking, “Oh, there he is, my boy.” It’s funny ’cause it’s true. – She don’t mind that – sort of stuff. – That’s why I’ve – got this personality now. – “Well done, well done, – darling.” I suppose what’s interesting is that inherently, innately, we already possess the creative power to control our own lives and to control our destiny. – Like, you see earlier, we were – mucking about that crucifix That Jesus was wearing. – Well, of course, Jesus has the – right to wear that crucifix – Because that’s – the resurrected Christ. See the wounds in His hands, the resurrected Christ. But also the cross was a religious symbol that preceded Christianity. African cultures worship the crucifix, Celtic cultures worshipped the crucifix – and it was widely regarded – to be the intersection – Of the two energies – necessary for life… Male and female. – And from the intersection of – those two energies, All life, all reality can be created. The vertical male phallic energy… – On a good day, if you – don’t take drugs, – If the weather’s – nice and warm… Perfectly normal, thank you… Intersecting with the horizontal vaginal energy of the female. Not like Ronald McDonald’s mouth, a sloppy blow job. No one needs that fucking shit in their religious life. – Where those – two energies intersect, All creativity is possible. We already have divine creative energy within us. – That’s what these stories are – trying to remind us, And we share that energy with each other and with the soil. And what is the most powerful of these energies, – the energy that the patriarchy – and misogyny Constantly tries to repress? The divine female sexual energy, the creative energy of the female. That is why I worship divine sexual female energy. Yes, thanks, thanks, thanks. I’m saying that not only because it’s true but also because it’s nearly the end of the show now – and I know if I say – stuff like that – About women – and divine sexual energy, At the end of the evening, there’s no way I ain’t getting laid after the show tonight. – How can you – compare the potency – Of the creative forces within – humanity? How can you even imagine the male energy has the potency of female sexual energy? Just witness the orgasms. “Oh! “More, hit me! Oh!” Versus… Female sexual energy’s so sublime, delicate and divine, even in masturbation, it’s an aesthetic spectacle, as if accompanied by a breeze and muslin drapes, a delicate Rachmaninoff concerto across the clitoris. Oh, that’s so beautiful. A sexuality so divine, so pleasing to the eye that it can be used on the telly to advertise chocolate. Flake adverts, Galaxy adverts, – that’s fucking female sexual – energy. “Oh, Flake, Flake, oh!” You cannot use male masturbation energy to sell chocolate. “Have a Flake!” I’ve given up masturbation now as a result of a trip to London Zoo. I see a chimpanzee doing it. I thought, no, man. – It’s not different – enough. Also male masturbatory energy, – that is the energy – of bigotry. – That is the energy – that doesn’t allow us To transcend the circuitry of it, the angry Rupert Murdoch, George Osborne, David Cameron energy of wanking. – Can’t even get his – fucking thumb up, – Can you imagine – what his cock looks like? Jesus Christ. Them people don’t know how to fuck properly. That’s why they’re angry. – That’s why their – policies are so ugly. George Osborne, that man… Try and think of him fucking. Try and think of it. – Doesn’t know how to – move his hips. – Doesn’t know – how to do the final move. Doesn’t know the G-spot, under turn. Doesn’t know how it works. – That’s why – they’re so angry. – They’re wanking – all the time. Cuts, cuts, ah! Guilty, angry little conservative wanks. – George Osborne never had an – orgasm that didn’t end up On his little tummy. Angry little wanks. “Cut the benefit! Ah!” – I bet when he comes, – it frightens him. “Oh! “Bad boy Georgie! Bad boy Georgie!” They don’t want us to have free, liberated sexual energy, access to the divine and infinite for our own infinite creativity. That is why I worship at the altar of the vagina. There will never be a clearer metaphor for God. From nothing comes all life, comes all creation and I’m happy to whisper my prayers and liturgies there on my knees night after night. And get it all in your mouth also. Don’t be scared of nothing down there. Don’t be afraid of anything on each other’s bodies. – George Osborne, – he wants boundaries, barriers, Rules down there. – “Don’t put that bit – in your mouth. That’s where poo poo comes from.” Get it in your gob! Right in there. Dilate it. Make it wink. And while we’re on the subject, let’s address the inequality and hypocrisy in the heterosexual world of the male/female ass-lick pact. How can rimming be considered a fair swap between the genders when the commodities are so different? The female, as if it’s been drawn by Walt Disney. “Ah, come here.” “Ahh!” So cute, so perfect, like it could dispense nothing more toxic than little pink Tic Tacs. “Ahh!” Get it in your gob. Free them. “Ahh! Ahh, I’m coming, I’m coming!” They always tell you. “I’m coming, I’m coming!” “I know, I know. It’s obvious, it’s obvious.” They don’t do that with other stuff. “I’m having a sandwich, I’m having a sandwich! I’m parallel parking, I’m parallel parking!” – Sometimes – I do it though. A little announcement. “I’m coming.” With me, it’s more warning. “I’m coming, so if you want to, please hurry up.” “My jaw hurts now.” – Liberate yourself – down there. Get it all in your mouth. – I’m coming, I’m coming, – I’m coming!” “Right. Now you do me.” Walt Disney’s circle replaced by the King Kong hair knot. Come on, take a bite of the old leather bagel. The Tic Tac tune drowned out by German oompah-pah music. – You want someone to put – that in their mouth, You’ve gotta make ’em come first. – You gotta make them access – the heroin That’s already within them, – the divinity – already within them, – The revolution that’s in every – single one of us. That is why I guarantee to any woman kind enough to sleep with me tonight, you will come first. Any woman that I sleep with will always be the first coming. And I will always be the second coming and that is why I’m a little bit like Jesus.
