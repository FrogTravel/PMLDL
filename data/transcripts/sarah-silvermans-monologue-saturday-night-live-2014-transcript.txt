 Sarah Silverman’s Monologue Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen — Sarah Silverman! Sarah Silverman : Thank you so much! Wow… it is SO crazy to be here hosting “Saturday Night Live.” Um… I meean, is it
 really crazy? Everybody always says that it’s so crazy to be here hosting “Saturday Night Live”. I’m a pretty big comedian… It kinda makes ALL the sense in the world! Uh… tonight is the end of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur, and, uh… Thank you…? And I just want to take this opportunity to say to all the Hasidic Jews out there: I promise you, God will mind if you wear a nice cotten blend in the summer. You are being ridiculous!
 Anyway, for those of you who don’t know me, um… I guess I’m know as a “blue” comedian, which is… I find that annoying, it kind of bothers me. I don’t think of myself that way. I think of myself more as a… as an IMPORTANT comedian. Anyway, because of this, uh, they had to censor a lot of my jokes after Dress Rehearsal. Like here’s what’s left of my
 favorite joke. Can we get a shot of Wally? Yeah! Guys, it was such a cute joke! It was totally innocuous. I saw Lorne laughing REALLY hard at it during Dress, like almost too hard at it. Screw it. Can I just, um… Is there like a handheld mike, or a…? Oh! Thank you. Let’s get real! Come on! This is live television! Let’s go among the people! How are you? Can I sit in your lap? Ohhhh… this feels nice! What is your name?
 Lindsey : It’s Lindsey. Sarah Silverman : It’s Lindsey ? Lindsey : Mmm-hmm. Sarah Silverman : Oh, um, I’m Sarah. Lindsey : Hi! Sarah Silverman : You know that. Uh, Lindsey, I want to tell you something that’s really important: You’re beautiful… and you… deserve love… and… I hope that you are as kind to yourself as you are to any schmo on the street. Um… and I love you.
 Lindsey : Thank you…! Sarah Silverman : Your turn. Lindsey : You’re amazing ? Sarah Silverman : Aww. Lindsey : And you’re beautiful. Sarah Silverman : Awwwww! Lindsey : And you’re smart! Sarah Silverman
 : Keep going. Be creative. Lindsey : You’re my favorite . Sarah Silverman : Awwwww! You know what it is, Lindsey, it’s like… I get sad sometimes. Like, I feel like… it’s over… In terms of like I’m never gonna be
 carried again. You know what I mean? Like, we’re grown-ups. We’re not gonna, you know, fall asleep at our parents’ party and overhear adults going like: “I got her.” “No, I’ll take her.” It’s never gonna happen again. Amd it makes me sad. It’s like, I
 want to be carried. I want to be… bathed and cared for. I want to get my hair shampooed, you know, like a… like a little child or a princess, or… a quadraplegic, I guess. Very similar lifestyles, very different circumstances. Am I sitting on your
 phone ? Lindsey : No. No, you’re good! Sarah Silverman : Oh… I want to think of an app! Wouldn’t it be great to think of that million-dollar app? Let’s think of that million-dollar app! God… I was thinking, like an hour ago, wouldn’t it be great if you had an app that told you when all of your friends were taking a doody? I was pretty excited.
 I would pay ninety-nine cents for that. But then, somebody told me that they have that. It’s like… I think it’s called “Words With Friends”? How old are you? Lindsey : 32. Sarah Silverman : You are ? Ohh, you’re 32! You’re only
 little , you don’t know nothin’ . Here’s some advice: If you’re ever drunk at a party, and you throw up at a party… I feel like you can save the moment if you can muster like… a “Ta-daaa!” Alright, I guess I should go back to the stage. You keep this. You can have that. You can have that!
 Sarah Silverman : Ohhh, God… this feels so right! I mean, it’s live . I could stay here. I love this stage. I mean, this is the first time I’ve hosted , but I have been on this stage before. I, um… I was like a
 featured performer on this show in the 90’s, and… I wasn’t in much, but a lot of times I’d mostly be, like, a “plant” in the audience, you know, asking fake questions to the host during the monologue, and, uh… Yes, you — you have a question?
 Young Sarah Silverman : I think you’re great! I love you! Sarah Silverman : Awwwww! I love you MORE! Alright, you have a question for me, sweetie? Young Sarah Silverman : Are you going to be doing any solo albums now that you’ve left Wilson Phillips?
 Sarah Silverman : GREAT question! You know, um… I left Wilson Phillips because I felt it really wasn’t my thing any more, and, uh, I’m not sure about a solo album, though the album of my stand-up special “We Are Miracles” is out now. Oh — yes?
 Young Sarah Silverman : Yeah, uh — What did you feed the dinosaurs? Sarah Silverman : Uh… What is this, Pretty Girl in the Audience Night? It’s crazy! Um… of course, the stegosauruses are the worst, they only eat plants. But the T-Rexes are carnivores — they’d be more inclined to eat
 you , ’cause you’re delicious! Let’s take a… Yes, you , Sparkleface over here. Young Sarah Silverman : Yeah, uh… what makes the human knee bend? Sarah Silverman : Okay. Um… Well, the knee is technically a joint, where the tibia and femur meet. Right? And the bending of the joint is aided by two menisky. I hope that helps, and I hope you stay this curious and strong for the next twenty years. I have a feeling that you
 will . And maybe someday you’ll even get to say: “We have got a GREAT show for you tonight! ALL of Maroon 5 is here! So stick around, and we’ll be right back!”
