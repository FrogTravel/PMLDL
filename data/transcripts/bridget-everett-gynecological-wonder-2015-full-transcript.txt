 Recorded at Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater I keep a picture of Bridget on my nightstand… because even though I’ve been in over 175 movies… I look at that picture and know that I can do better. I can be better. I can be… Bridget. Every night, when I tuck my little girls in… I tell them, “If you work really hard, and you dream really, really big… “and you stick with it, one day when you’re big, big girls… “if you’re really lucky… “you just might be the next Bridget Everett.” Do you know how much I’d like to suckle on Bridget’s titties? So much. I am vegan, and I would like to suckle on Bridget’s tits. I want to suckle those titties. You ever seen a raccoon in a garbage? That’s me… with Bridget’s pussy. I’m gonna suckle that titty Chardonnay. Fucking drink it all up. The garbage is Bridget’s pussy and I’m the raccoon. I don’t care that I’m lactose intolerant and I don’t care who knows. I want those titties. I just love cabaret. If Jesus Christ were alive today, he’d have great tits… he’d be singing cabaret and his name would be Bridget fucking Everett. Bridget. Bridget. Bridget. Oh, shit! My baby! Boy, it really is windy out here… but it is expected to get increasingly windy as the night goes by. That concludes part seven of our– Excuse me, my water just broke, you filthy, fucking cunt! ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, Bridget Everett!
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to Joe’s Pub! My name is Bridget Everett. Some of you may not know me, but you will not fucking forget me! I’m coming here tonight to get drunk and talk about love… whatever the fuck that is! I hope you’re ready, honey! Because shit is about to get ridiculous! That’s right, honey, I’d fuck anything… even you. Ladies and gentlemen, my mother couldn’t be here tonight. But if she was here, she would tell you that there are three things in life that matter. Living large, loving large and Barry fucking Manilow! Yeah!
 What’s up, everybody? Anybody freaking out right now? Yeah, you should be! Oh, shit. Let me just clear up a couple quick things. Bridget, you wearing a bra? Nope, don’t need one! Next question. What the fuck? What the fuck is about to happen? You don’t know and neither do I! Hey, honey, hi. You guys been to the show before? And you’re sitting in the front row? You sick bitch. All right, let me just sit down for a second. I was just recently diagnosed with shortness of breath. You ever seen a pussy before? Oh, shit! You like feet? Yeah? That’s cute. I got two. All right, ladies and gentlemen. I know a lot of you, you look up here… and all you see is a classic, all-American beauty Bridget Everett. But I gotta tell you, it wasn’t always like this. When I was a little girl, I was real fucked up looking. Like for a while, I had just one front tooth… and my brothers back in Bryant called me Fang, right? So I joined the swim team to get some dignity and some self-respect. And I was good, and the better I got, the broader my shoulders got… and then they started calling me Lurch, that guy from the Addam’s Family. You call me that in the street, I’m gonna cut your dick off, okay? Thank you so much. And then, my nipples came in. Like not my tits, just my nipples. And they got everybody at school calling me Little Nippy Titty. So, I ran home, it was a Friday night. I remember, because I was watching Dallas and the Dukes of Hazzard, right? And I’m sitting on the couch, and I’m crying. And my mom, she looks at me, she says, “Bridget, what’s wrong?” I said, “Nothing.” She said, “Bridget, what’s wrong?” I said, “Nothing.” And then she slid her hand down the back of my pants. Like not in a fucked up way, but because I got real soft skin, you’ll see. Then she said, “Bridget, what’s wrong?” I said, “Well, Brock and Brian got everybody at school calling me Little Nippy Titty.” Do you know what she said to me? Do you know what she said to me? She said… Then she said, “Come with me, let’s have a drink.” She said, “Bridget, you’re a woman now. “You gotta stand tall and be proud of what your momma gave you, do you hear me?”
 I’m just gonna do a quick costume change. Now, a lot of people come to this show… and they worry about the Tender Moments, my band… because they don’t get to see much, you know? But this part… is for them. Is there anybody here tonight that’s in love? How about you two with the matching sweaters from the Upper East Side? Are you guys in love? See, the way I always thought it would be was like… every morning you wake up, right? And she gives you a little kiss and your heart purrs like a little kitten, is that right? Every morning. And then like, if you wake up feeling all fat and shit… he says, “Don’t worry about it, baby. You still got great tits.” Is that right? And when you make love, he knows not– not just when, but how hard to choke you, am I right? Me? Yeah, I’ve been in love, too, thank you for asking. The year was 1982, she’s a very pretty girl. She was, um, a little Downs-ey, but I like that shit, you know. Her name was Jeanine… Jeanine the Machine and– Nobody would talk to her, you know, so I sat with her at the lunch table… and played Two Square with her and tetherball and all that bullshit, you know. And my friends Stephanie and Ilana, they were pissed. So I thought, you know what? I want to have a sleepover, a little slumber party, old school. It’s 1982, that’s the kind of shit people used to do back then… when they fucking cared about people. So I have everybody over there, we’re in my basement. And the mood was, um, I’m just gonna say, you know, RFC… real fucking chilly. Nobody was looking at anybody, nobody was talking or anything. I thought, “You know, let’s play a little game of ping pong.” Who doesn’t like ping pong? Everybody likes ping pong. You guys like ping pong? Everybody likes ping pong? So there we were. It was Stephanie and Ilana versus Bridget and Jeanine. Stephanie slammed a ball right into my little pooter right here… but I caught that motherfucker. Just– That’s when this thing still had a little spring left in it. She sits down her paddle. I dropped the ball. She says, “Hey, Bridget, how about a game of truth or dare?” I said, “I’m about it.” So I sit everybody down. I freshen everybody’s drinks. Stephanie looks at me, she says, “All right, Bridget, truth or dare?” I said, “Dare, bitch.” she said, “I dare you to take Jeanine into the closet and French kiss her for 45 seconds.” I said, “No problem.” So I take Jeanine by the hand, I walk her into the closet. And I do what I do. And I gotta tell you, her tongue was so sweet… it tasted just like a green apple Jolly Rancher. And up until that point, I’d never made love to anybody… other than my brother, but this shit felt nice, you know? So we’re laying there in the closet, you know? And I can feel that little fucking Jolly Rancher on my tongue. I’m holding her little TST… her little tube sock titty. I lift up my dress and I say, “Hey, I wore these for you.” “You want to touch it?” She said no. Hit the track. Are you sure?
 Open wide. You remember me? You want to go for a ride? Come here. Hop on. Hop on. Hop on. Ladies and gentlemen… you know what they say? They say memories, you never know when you’re gonna make one. Jeanine, are you ready to dance for me? Are you ready to dance for me? Sure. You ready? You ready? Help her out! Here we go!
 Give it up for Jeanine! I’ve been pregnant many times. And even though I never carried one of those babies to term… I still consider myself a wonderful mother. Hold on, I have a surprise for you. Uncle Adam? Thank you so much. My friend Amber came over to my house one time. She said, “Bridget, what’s with all the dolls?” I said, “Those aren’t dolls, those are my babies.” Thank you, Adam. This is Olivia. Here, hold my baby. Well, a few weeks ago, it was my birthday, right? You know, it was a big one. And, um, Mommy was getting a little cranky around the house. So my kids, they said, “Mommy, you gotta get out of the house.” I said, “Okay.” So, I left Saturday morning, and I got home sometime Monday night. I can’t tell you what I did, but I know I had a real nice time. Anyway, Tuesday morning I wake up, right? And I can smell smoke. Are there any mothers in the house? Okay, good. What’s the first thing you think of when you smell smoke? I’ll tell you. Where are my babies at? So I look to the left, right? I look to the left, and there’s Precious in her jar. And then– The twins were over there, the red-headed twins were over there behind the couch… but I didn’t see Olivia. And then I remembered that Mommy came in a little hot Monday night, you know. I don’t know what Olivia said, she might not have said anything… but I put her in time-out, you know? And she’s such a good, little girl, that she stayed there all night long. But Mommy never came and got her, because Mommy was drunk. And by the time I found her– This is a cautionary tale, you’re very pregnant. By the time I found her, her little legs had buckled… and her face had melted to the radiator. And she looked at me and she said, “Mommy, is it bad?” Ssh. She said, “Mommy, is it bad?”
 Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Olivia always had the sweetest, little singing voice. I mean, it’s not the same now that she’s got this little shit stain on her face. It’s like when your cousin did all that cocaine for all those years… and his nose slid off his face. Now when he talks– She’s a very brave, little girl, ladies and gentlemen. She never likes to miss a show. Here, hold my baby. This one’s for my little girls. Get ’em up on their feet and take them around the room. Put her hands up. Put her hands up. Fellas, are you ready? We’ll do that tight little chorus. Get off your feet and walk my fucking baby around the room, motherfucker! Just because you dumped your load all over town… and don’t take responsibility for a woman’s baby… doesn’t mean you can’t take responsibility for my baby tonight! Darling you Baby ♪ I know a lot of you look up here… you’re like, “Man, there’s a woman that’s really got her shit together. And you’re right. I got great tits. I got the voice of an angel. And I got a pussy. I got a pussy. I got a pussy that’s– that’s so soft… that when you’re inside it… It feels like you’re sliding up and down a stick of butter. Do you like butter? Everybody likes butter, right? Everything’s better with butter. It’s like you’re always at the movies. That’s right. Duh-duh… Some people are like, you know, “Bridget, you drink too much. But I don’t drink ’cause I have a problem. I drink because it’s fucking delicious. And I know that some of you got problems. I mean, I look around the room and I see some really fucked-up looking people here tonight. Jeanine, if you weren’t before, you are now. Do– do you have a family? Do you spend the holidays and shit with them? You know you don’t have to, right? Just kidding. No, I love my mother. I’m a momma’s girl. And a lot of what she told me… brought me here to this stage tonight. Right? She said, “Bridget, always eat before you go out to dinner… “so you don’t embarrass yourself.” Check, done. Number two, your father’s a prick. Check, done. And number three– now go home and tell your baby this tonight. She said, “Bridget, a woman isn’t really a woman until she tries anal.” Hit the track! This song goes out to anybody with a pussy! And I’m not talking about a vagina! I’m talking about a pussy!
