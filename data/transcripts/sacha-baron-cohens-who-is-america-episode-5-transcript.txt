♪ I don’t remember!      ♪ * * * Ex-Con Second Chance On tonight’s show, Rick Sherman tries to make it in the world of electronic dance music. Jake Inphamous: Welcome to Miami, my brother. Good to finally meet you, man. Have a seat, man. Make yourself at home. Let’s, uh — Let’s chop it up.
So I started — You know, I had two years left. And I thought, “Am I gonna waste my time here in jail?” I thought, “No, I’m gonna make an EDM track.” So that’s what I did. I went around and I recorded things ’round jail.
So I’m gonna get to hear this track? Yeah, you want to hear it? Can you tell me what the different, like, claps and basses and all that — Yeah. So one of the riffs about 35 seconds in, it’s, like, a dinner hall mess tray smashing off someone’s head.
And then, a lot of the basses and the synth and the twanging of the springs under the top bunk. Hey, hey. Then we got like, toilet flushes, people, like, vomiting. You know, pissing, whatever. This is a buggery. This is the buggery.
Is that you? What’s that? Is that you? Uh… Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was. But you know what? So what? You know, we’ve got someone being stabbed. You know, I didn’t do the stabbing. Sorry, mate, I’m gonna stab you. It’s for a song.
It’s a tragedy when someone gets stabbed, but the good thing is I was there to record it. And so, in a way, they’ve given their life to art. I mean, if it’s happening, might as well capture it. Exactly.
Watch your fucking teeth. I never saw a fucking thing, mate. I never saw a fucking thing. I think that’s a masterpiece, man. Kept me, like, at the edge of my seat. You’re joking. You’re just mocking me.
No, no. Actually sounds very, like, UK, too. -I like that. Sure. Well, they’re all — All the people doing the stabbing and the sodomy are all British. That’s awesome, man. I’m really interested in this. If you’re okay with it, I’d like to put you, like, in an actual, real booth in a stage, and I would love to hear this dropped.
That is amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are there gonna be girls at the club? Yeah, yeah. It’s usually girls at the club. Girls do love deejays, man. Oh, really? No, that’s what I’ve heard. Yeah. What for? What, like —
And deejays love deejays. And this — Yeah, yeah, yeah. Once, you know, you break the ice, you’re good, man. You’re back in the game. Break a what? Break the ice, you know? Oh, I thought you’d break her eyes.
No, no, no, not “break her eyes.” Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that. If I make all the calls, I’ll definitely find a party that matches this sound. And I’m definitely gonna get it out there. That would be amazing. Brilliant.
Later, my brother. Amazing. His whole story is extreme. His music’s extreme. So I really think the scene really needs stuff like that. Two days later, Jake called. He’d scored an opportunity for Rick, now renamed DJ Solitary, to perform at Sway, one of Florida’s most influential nightclubs.
Jake! My man! How’s it going? What’s going on, my brother. Hey, how are you? Hello. Wow! Hey! Wow, that’s amazing. Wow, they’re, like, real — real girls. Yeah, they’re real girls. Yeah, we’re real girls. Whoa, amazing. Whoa.
So the question is, man, you ready for tonight or what? Yeah, right. Jake said that deejays gets BJs. What’s a BJ? What’s a BJ? Can you please tell him what a BJ is? Oh. A blow job. Oh, like fellatio?
Yes, like fellatio. Oh, oh, yeah. Deejays get BJs. For sure. Not necessarily from me, but in general, deejays get BJs. Oh, no, no, no, I’m not assuming at all it would come from you. I’m a bit nervous ’cause I ain’t been around many dolly birds. My mom always said, you know, “You’re so ugly that you’d just go out and start robbing.” And then, once I got caught, she said, “Luckily, you’re so ugly that no one’s actually gonna ever touch your posterior.” But the joke’s on her ’cause I actually got sodomized almost every day.
We got something special for you tonight. We got DJ Solitary making his United States debut. Give it up for DJ Solitary! Here we go! I fucking love him. I love him! You did a great job. I was crying. I’m so proud of you.
Oh, thank you so much. You did so good. I need more of that. I need more DJ Solitary. Give me another one. Oh, great. BJ or no BJ? Not from me, but I can find you somebody. Oh, great. That would be great.
I’ll keep my eyes open. * * * ♪ We are going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. There is a secret society that I’ve found called the American Cancer Society. Liberal elites are raising money to give Americans cancer.
I’m here with Corey Lewandowski . He was the campaign manager for President Donald J. Trump. And so he helped get elected the greatest president we’ve had whose gonna be looking after the interests of the common man.
Donald Trump: Corey. Good job, Corey. Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, charged for alleged simple battery of a female reporter. I read today about a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome who was taken from her mother and put in a cage.
Womp, womp. I read about a — a — Did you just say, “Womp, womp”? Is Donald Trump a racist, or is he the least racist man alive? I can tell you this, I had the privilege of standing and sitting next to candidate Trump and now the president for thousands of hours over my tenure running his campaign. Never, ever, ever did I ever hear him utter a racist word in his life, ever.
I mean, if he was a racist, why would he have moved into a black man’s house? No, that’s the people’s house. Look, the White House — No, but he didn’t rebuild it, didn’t say, “I’m not gonna move in there,” didn’t knock it down.
The president doesn’t look at race. Never has. -Of course. -It’s a non-issue to him. I wanna say, with Charlottesville, where people attacked our president, why should the president pick a side between anti-fascist and fascist? He’s the president of all people.
There is a place and a time to disagree with people everywhere, okay? You don’t have to agree with people. Wait, you have to respect them, and you can’t be attacking them. Exactly, you can’t be — you can’t be attacking honest, fascist people who just want to express their right to start a genocide. That is their right.
Look, I don’t know about that, but what I do know is this — All right, okay. If the law says that people can do a peaceful protest, they should be allowed to do that. Listen, I do not hate Jews. I am not an anti-yosemite. In fact, some of my very good friends hate Jews. Now let’s talk about mainstream media.
Mm-hmm. Shouldn’t we be worried about who really owns the media? I don’t know who owns it. I mean, I think it’s the shareholders who own it. PBS. PBS. This may be public broadcasting, but look at that. If you move those bits and shrink them… it shows the proof that they are owned by the biggest force in politics.
I don’t know what that is. That is smoking marijuana. Why? Because they are owned by the Rastafarian lobby. I wouldn’t know anything about that. The Rastafarian lobby were behind a lot of the military decisions of the last 30 years. The invasion of Iraq was because the Rastafarian lobby, their leader, General Robert Marley, suggested that they had over — I think they developed over 45,000 buffalo soldiers, these dread-locked Rastas who were marching through Africa into the heart of America. And then the plan was to take them into Iraq.
I don’t know if that qualifies as conclusive evidence, but, you know, I’ve never seen that before. I’m not sure. Let’s talk about one thing they accuse Donald Trump of — Donald J. Trump, the president. They accuse him of being a misogynist. Donald Trump said, “There is no one who respects women more than me.” Is that the truth, or is it a lie?
Look, his actions demonstrate that that’s true. Of course! And the fact that — He’s a — He’s basically a feminist. Now, look, the American people are so smart. They don’t believe it anymore. They don’t believe the fake news which has been there —
That’s true. I wanna give people out there evidence. Here he is with the president of Germany. Look where his eyes are — looking straight in the eyes. He’s not looking at the titties. He’s looking straight at the eyes, which is what a feminist would do.
Looks like a person who respects a lot of people. What about when he said of Miss Venezuela, he called her “Miss Piggy.” Is that sexist? Look, I think the president was reacting to something that he wanted to react to, but —
I know also, Miss Piggy is the most powerful and admired of all the Muppets. She’s not a weak woman. I mean, Miss Piggy — Yeah, I don’t know about that. * * * [ woman speaking Italian ] Wouldn’t you love to live the rich and famous life?

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon. There’s no police brutality in America. We ended that back in the ’60s. Four people have died in his jail in Milwaukee County, including an infant.
We now going to talk about issues while we are doing the unboxing. So let’s talk about the dangerous people who marched in Charlottesville, or as they’re called “Antifa.” What are they like? Antifa is an anarchist group, all right? They promote chaos. So they come in. Again, this is not protest. When you start trashing buildings, breaking into buildings, stealing stuff —
Amazing! It’s Mackenzie Maple Donut! Dab. Dab. Jazz hands! ♪ Tell me about Antifa. Should I join them? Uh… Can I join Antifa? Mackenzie Maple Donut, do not join Antifa. They — They support killing of police officers. They support disorder.
So if you were the sheriff in the ’30s in Germany and the anti-fascists were marching, the Antifa were marching, what would you have done to stop them? Well, you have to act aggressively. When I say that, you have to use force to disperse the crowd. You have to be willing to arrest people, take then to jail.
Exactly. It’s a shame that there weren’t brave sheriffs like you around in Germany in the ’30s, because you could have protected the fascists and let them speak their mind a bit clearer, and then things could have been done a bit quicker.
Well, you don’t want to take sides. When you say, “Protect the fascists.” You don’t want to take sides. Of course. Particularly not in Germany in the ’30s. ♪ Okay, let’s have a look. OMG, big, big fun. “Hey, Sheriff,” says, SharkBait007. Deplorable Don, “Sheriff, if I am 32, is it legal to date a 14-year-old in Alabama?”
Absolutely not. Okay, so you have the answer there. ♪ Now it’s “smell your fingers” time. Will you smell your fingers? Because you had them — -Mm-hmm. Do your fingers smell of box? No, they smell sweet.
My fingers smell like my sister after she been roller skating. Wow, I’m not going there. Oh, no, unfortunately, she was murdered three years ago. Oh, that’s terrible. I know, and they didn’t find who did it because they didn’t look in the lake.

The man just shot 600 people! What are you going to do about it?! We’re not going to do much of anything, hopefully. How did you get to overcome your instinct and be able to shoot the youth? Well, I haven’t done that. What we do is teach and promote youth shooting sports.
You shoot the youth for sport? No. No, in the United States, there are several different disciplines of competitive shooting. So it is to train? It’s to promote safe use with kids. But there’s something wrong with the culture that we can’t talk about kids being around guns.
It is crucial to have the guns in the schools. Yes, absolutely. I absolutely agree with you. Well, one time in my nephew class, a man come in, shouts, screaming at them. The kids take out guns. Bang, bang, bang. That substitute teacher did not stand a chance.
Right, right. Two of the classmates shot, but mistake can happen. And it saved more lives than it harmed. Exactly. Have you ever been in a terrorist attack? No. I have been in 14, and I have started three.
Wow. What happen in a terror attack? It’s chaos. And what the natural instinct? Is to retreat. To be quiet. Yeah. Yeah. The voice retreat. So we will have a conversation now but shouting. You must use your voice as a weapon.

We are in a shopping center. One of these baby is wearing a suicide diaper. We take the diaper off. We put it in the trash can. We close. And then we go on the floor. The bomb is going to go off in 10 seconds. Ready? Go! 10…nine…eight… seven…six… five…four…three… two…one. Go! Bang! Why did you put that baby in the trash can?
Because I wanted to get the bomb to as safe a place as I could, more than anything else. This baby didn’t have the bomb. Okay. Please do not put the wrong baby in the trash can. No, that would be a bad thing.
In the Mossad — I mean, not in the Mossad. We prefer to remove the bomb and put that away and save the baby if we can. Sure. Because we found out that some of them do not really believe in the ideology. And not all of these babies are Jihadi.
Right. Okay, now I am going to teach you how to survive a beheading. Oh, okay, I’m very interested. I survive two beheading. Wow. I want to know how to do this, sir. There is only one defense. Okay. You want to learn it?
