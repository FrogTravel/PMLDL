 Saturday Night Live, Season 1: Episode 7 Don Pardo: Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Pryor! Richard Pryor: How you doin’? Thank you very much for coming here to New York. Uh, hope I’m funny. I’d like to dedicate this to, uh, show to Miles Davis, my friend. He’s in the hospital, sick. But he’s cool. Miles always gets women, though, ’cause he talks so cool. You know, Miles go: “What’s happenin’?”
 I get women, too. I can’t keep ’em but I get ’em. Women always leave me, man! I don’t mind ’em leavin’ but they tell you why. You know what I mean? Just leave! Don’t tell me why! ‘Cause there ain’t nothin’ you can do but stand there and look silly, right? You be … And the madder you get, women get cool when you get mad. “WELL, GO ON AND GET OUT THEN!” “I’m leaving.” “I DON’T EVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!” “Don’t worry, you shan’t.”
 Drive you to drink, jack, you know? I tried drinkin’ for a while but I used to go into bars and check out the people that were drinkin’ and they weren’t happy. And they get beat up a lot. No — drunks, they start out cool. Brother be cool at first and he goin’: “Give me a Scotch and soda, please.” Real cool. ‘Bout a hour later: “WHAT?! WHAT YOU MEAN I’M DRUNK?! HUH? I wasn’t drunk when I came in here! And I ain’t gonna leave till I’m sober. Now, you can dig that, baby. Bartender?! Are you the bartender? Give everybody in here somethin’. Give ’em a beer.
 And twenty straws. Ha ha! Whoooo!” “Hey! Huh? What you lookin’ at, bitch? What? No, I don’t know what time it is. It’s time for you to stop messin’ with me. That’s what time it is. I know I’m ugly but I don’t look like no clock. That’s right, baby. What? What are you worried about? You the bartender. If I say somethin’ to this piece of wood, then you say somethin’. Otherwise, you can freeze on your thing, baby. You know, ’cause I’ll bust you apart. Ha haaaa! Whooo! What you want, big ol’ dude? Apologize to who? For what? I don’t care if she your mama– Hey, man! Wait a minute, man! I’m just kiddin’, man, baby. What you doin’?! You done kick me in the ass, baby! You in a world o’ trouble now! No, don’t hold him — let him go, baby! Come on, you want some of me? Wait a minute, man. I’m only kiddin’ ya now.”
 That’s why I don’t drink so much. Take acid, either. White dudes take acid. They do. They take acid and go see “The Exorcist.” They crazy. White dude gave me some acid once at a party, too, jack. And I thought I was crazy before I took it. It saned me right up. Dude say: “This is far out.” I said, “What?” Says: “It’s far out.” I took it, jack. “You’re gonna be trippin’!”
 ‘Bout twenty minutes later, I was at the party: “Hey, blood, what’s happenin’? Everything is cool. White dude gave me some stuff I’m gonna be trippin’! You know, I ain’t goin’ no place without my luggage. Believe that. Look at this, man! I can catch my hand! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Uh oh. I’ve got to get out of here! Whaaaaaaaa! I don’t remember how to breathe! I can’t breathe! One, two, three. Ain’t nothin’ happenin’, man!” “Told ya it was far out!”
 “I’m gonna die! I don’t even know who I am, I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! I’m gonna die! What – in – the – world – is – happening – to – me?!”
